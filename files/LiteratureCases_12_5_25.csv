1,"They all had normal cognitive and psychomotor development till the age of 5-6 months. At that point, they suffered from prolonged convulsions triggered by fever. Seizures were short in the beginning, lasted for less than 5 minutes, and healed by themselves. With time, they turn to become afebrile, lasted for longer duration (between 10 and 20 minutes), thus requiring the need of acute treatment to stop the convulsions. Seizure types were either generalized, in 5 of the 8 patients, or focal in the case of the 3 others, with a frequency ranging from 1 to 4 seizures per month. The generalized seizures in the 5 patients were associated with tonic-clonic movements of the 4 extremities, perioral cyanosis, uprolling of the eyes, and a short post-ictal phase of less than 30 minutes. Two of the patients with focal seizures had abnormal clonic movements in the upper right extremity, and one had tonic-clonic movements in the right upper and lower extremities with deviation of the mouth during the crisis to the right side. One out of the 8 patients also had myoclonic jerks. The crises were noncured or partially cured by anti-epileptic drugs. In three of the patients, neurocognitive decline was already present.","IT","SCN1A",,"DRAVET SYNDROME; DRVT","607208",,"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2019/5270503","{""HP:0001268"":""Mental deterioration"",""HP:0001336"":""Myoclonus"",""HP:0002069"":""Generalized tonic-clonic seizures"",""HP:0002197"":""Generalized-onset seizure"",""HP:0002266"":""Focal clonic seizures"",""HP:0002373"":""Febrile seizures"",""HP:0006813"":""Hemiclonic seizures"",""HP:0011172"":""Complex febrile seizures"",""HP:0032556"":""Circumoral cyanosis"",""HP:0040168"":""Focal seizures, afebril""}","{""HP:0001263"":""Psychomotor developmental delay"",""HP:0002373"":""Febrile seizures"",""HP:0011171"":""Simple febrile seizures"",""HP:0011172"":""Complex febrile seizures"",""HP:0040168"":""Seizures, partial, afebrile"",""HP:0002197"":""Generalized-onset seizure"",""HP:0010818"":""Generalized tonic seizures"",""HP:0007359"":""Partial seizures"",""HP:0002384"":""Complex focal seizures"",""HP:0011157"":""Focal sensory seizure"",""HP:0002069"":""Generalized tonic-clonic seizures"",""HP:0032556"":""Circumoral cyanosis"",""HP:0010802"":""Perioral hyperpigmentation"",""HP:0000961"":""Cyanosis"",""HP:0011127"":""Perioral eczema"",""HP:0000520"":""Protruding eyes"",""HP:0002372"":""Normal interictal EEG"",""HP:0025373"":""Interictal EEG abnormality"",""HP:0011182"":""Interictal epileptiform activity"",""HP:0002266"":""Localized clonic seizure"",""HP:0006813"":""Unilateral clonic seizures"",""HP:0011169"":""Generalized clonic seizures"",""HP:0001336"":""Myoclonic jerks"",""HP:0007000"":""Morning myoclonic jerks"",""HP:0002123"":""Myoclonic seizures"",""HP:0003739"":""Myoclonic spasms"",""HP:0001250"":""Epilepsy"",""HP:0001268"":""Cognitive decline, progressive"",""HP:0002344"":""Neurologic deterioration""}","[""OMIM:300868"",""ORPHA:33069"",""OMIM:616973"",""ORPHA:1941"",""ORPHA:86909"",""ORPHA:725"",""ORPHA:101039"",""OMIM:620806"",""OMIM:607208"",""ORPHA:140927"",""OMIM:604403"",""OMIM:617350"",""OMIM:614558"",""OMIM:121200"",""OMIM:619317"",""OMIM:616981"",""OMIM:620145"",""OMIM:220120"",""ORPHA:36387"",""OMIM:254900""]","[""Multiple congenital anomalies-hypotonia-seizures syndrome 2"",""Dravet syndrome"",""Mental retardation, autosomal dominant 42"",""Juvenile absence epilepsy"",""Myoclonic epilepsy of infancy"",""Continuous spikes and waves during sleep"",""Female restricted epilepsy with intellectual disability"",""Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 116"",""Epileptic encephalopathy, early infantile, 6 (Dravet syndrome)"",""Benign familial neonatal-infantile seizures"",""Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus, type 2"",""Epileptic encephalopathy, early infantile, 52"",""Epileptic encephalopathy, early infantile, 13"",""Seizures, benign familial neonatal, 1"",""Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 6B, non-Dravet"",""Epileptic encephalopathy, early infantile, 37"",""Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 109"",""D-glyceric aciduria"",""Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures-plus"",""Epilepsy, progressive myoclonic, 4, with or without renal failure""]"

However, he could follow a normal educational training. When he was 16 years old, he was hospitalized for an acute paranoid delirium, which resolved after 2 months. Three years later he experienced another acute episode but with persistence of psychotic features suggestive of paranoid schizophrenia. During the following years, he became clumsy with poor upper limbs coordination. Cognitive troubles appeared, including apathy, memory impairment and a dysexecutive syndrome which progressively worsened. At 21 years of age, neurological examination revealed a tetra pyramidal syndrome, gait and limbs cerebellar ataxia, dysarthric speech, dysphagia and VSO. At the age of 24 years, he had lost gait and speech. Dystonic postures involving hands and legs and myclonic jerks appeared. Gastrostomy was performed at 26 years because of severe deglutition problems. Mild cortical and subcortical atrophy were reported on brain MRI.

8,"This 40-year-old female had normal psychomotor development, with normal schooling, and worked as an employee in a supermarket. She had two normal pregnancies. When 30 years old, she suffered from an acute persecutive delusion with acoustic hallucinations. Persistent delusion led to the diagnosis of dysthymic schizophrenia. Despite chronic therapy with neuroleptics and mood stabilizers, she experienced eight delusion relapses in 6 years requiring hospitalizations at each time. She refused medical follow-up for the next 4 years. During this period, in addition to psychotic features, she developed slow dysarthric speech, attention and memory impairment, dysphagia and ataxic gait. At the age of 40 years, neurological examination revealed VSO, gait cerebellar ataxia, pyramidal signs, left upper limb rest tremor and rigidity. Neuropsychological evaluation showed dementia with non-fluent aphasia, apragmatism, anosognosia, perseverations, memory impairment, visuoconstructive apraxia and prosopagnosia. Her gait progressively worsened and at the age of 42 years, she was unable to walk alone. Abdominal ultrasonography disclosed hepatomegaly and splenomegaly.

Lipid analysis of frozen spleen tissue performed by one of us (M.T.V.) revealed a typical NPC pattern and the diagnosis was definitely confirmed later on skin fibroblasts. His psychomotor development was normal and he attended normal school until 15 years old, when his parents and teachers first noticed behavioural disturbances including social isolation, self mutilations, aggressiveness and hyperphagia. A psychiatric evaluation revealed a depressive syndrome. An insulin dependent diabetes mellitus developed at the age of 16 years. Gait abnormalities with falls appeared when he was 19 years old and progressively worsened. At the age of 24 years, behavioural disturbances led to institutionalization. Neurological examination found gait and upper limbs cerebellar syndrome and VSO. Neuropsychological evaluation was not possible.

18,"This male patient experienced reading difficulties in childhood. These were not due to VSO, but rather to a problem in understanding the syllabus system. He could follow normal schooling with help and a professional training course in floriculture. When 14 years old, he had falls due to abrupt loss of muscular tone without loss of consciousness, which were retrospectively suggestive of cataplexy. When 15 years old, a teacher noticed he had difficulties to look downwards. At 17 years he first visited a neurologist who noted a cerebellar syndrome and VSO. Abdominal echography showed splenomegaly. The diagnosis of NPC was made. Ataxia worsened and at 21 years, he had to use a wheelchair. From 23 years, he also exhibited dysarthria, hand dystonic postures and choreic movements. From 20 years, he started to present acute psychiatric troubles with agitation, aggressiveness, visual and auditive hallucinations and delusion. These episodes occurred at an average rate of once per year, lasting ∼15 days each time and were well controlled with treatment. MRI could not be performed because of choreic movements.

20,"A 23-year-old man presented with two months of exertional dyspnea and cough with progressive malaise and lethargy. He denied any weight gain, swelling, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He was diagnosed at age 9 months and is the only child of fourth cousin parents of Portugese ancestry. There is no family history of inherited metabolic disease, heart disease, or sudden unexplained deaths. He was initially treated with levo-carnitine, but had stopped taking it for 5 years as he reported unpleasant “fishy” body and urine odour. Examination revealed a blood pressure of 115/87 mmHg, a regular heart rate of 122 beats per minute, respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute on room air. The jugular venous pulsation was elevated above the angle of the jaw. His apex was laterally displaced. A normal S1, physiologically split S2, and S3 were auscultated. The remainder of the cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, musculoskeletal, neurological, and dermatological examination was unremarkable. Investigations revealed a normal complete blood count. Brain natriuretic peptide was elevated at 2067 pg/mL and troponin I levels were undetectable. Urinary organic acid analysis by mass spectrometry detected massive amounts of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric and methylglutaconic acids. Serum total free carnitine was 11 μmol/L (normal 16–66 μmol/L), total carnitine 17 μmol/L (normal 25–88 μmol/L), and beta-hydroxybutyrate was undetectable. Creatinine kinase and thyroid stimulating hormone were normal. Viral studies were negative. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. Chest radiograph showed an increased cardiothoracic ratio, a small left pleural effusion, and normal pulmonary vascularity and interstitial markings. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging revealed severe left ventricular enlargement (left ventricular end diastolic volume of 354 mL) with an ejection fraction of 15% and an apical thrombus, severe right ventricular dysfunction, severe biatrial enlargement, but no valvular disease.

21,"A 17-year-old male patient presented to the emergency room acutely ill. Since childhood the patient was fed with frequent carbohydrate rich meals during daytime and with a continuous corn-starch based formula at night administered through a percutaneous gastric feeding tube. The patient’s level of metabolic control was suboptimal, and he suffered from severe hepatomegaly, nephromegaly, hyperlipidemia, and short stature. He had been hospitalized several times for severe lactic academia usually associated with fasting or nonadherence to the recommended diet. These episodes responded to treatment with dextrose and bicarbonate infusions.

The patient had been feeling ill for at least 7 days and had a 2-day history of nausea, weakness, and dyspnea. He had been unable to eat for several days and had not received his usual nighttime corn-starch based formula. Even though he had felt sick, he had delayed coming to the emergency room or notifying his physicians. Emergency medical personnel who were called to take him to the hospital noted respiratory distress and a blood glucose of 28 mg/dL. During transport, he was given intravenous dextrose.

On arrival to the emergency room, the patient appeared dyspneic with a Kussmaul respiratory pattern, pronounced tachycardia, and a state of high anxiety. His blood pressure was 143/78, and rectal temperature was 36.5°C. On physical examination, the patient was highly anxious and diaphoretic and had a firm enlarged liver. Laboratory testing done on admission indicated that the patient’s hypoglycemia had been reversed (serum glucose of 133 mg/dL (7.4 mmol/L)), but there was a severe metabolic acidosis (pH of 7.11, HCO3, 4 mEq/L, and pCO2, 12.8 mmHg).

22,"A 66-year-old male business manager with past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and intermittent sinusitis was transferred to our tertiary care center for progressive encephalopathy and concern for nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

Three weeks prior to admission, he was prescribed a 10-day course of levofloxacin for presumed sinusitis. As cough and postnasal drip did not improve, he was treated with two courses of methylprednisolone in addition to levofloxacin and subsequently clarithromycin. Two days prior to presentation, he developed headaches and sinus pressure and complained about “feeling off,” epigastric pain, and dry heaving. The night prior to presentation, he awoke frequently throughout the night with progressive confusion. The patient did not have fever, chills, or sweats. His family reported a history of anxiety, panic attacks, claustrophobia, and anger outbursts, with the last notable outburst having occurred about 6 months earlier. Of note, coworkers found a collection of various over-the-counter vitamins and nutritional supplements at the patient’s desk.

Given increasing confusion and agitation, the patient was taken to another hospital where he became progressively more obtunded, requiring intubation for airway protection. He was empirically started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir for concern of infectious meningoencephalitis. CSF analysis revealed elevated total protein at 53 mg/dL, glucose of 160 mg/dL (serum glucose: 240 mg/dL), no pleocytosis (1 WBC/mm3), negative CSF VDRL, negative West nile virus IgM and IgG, negative cryptococcal antigen, and negative fungal and bacterial cultures. Due to development of teeth grinding and concern for subclinical seizure activity, a routine electroencephalogram (EEG) was performed that revealed no seizure activity, however findings consistent with global cerebral dysfunction. He was started on phenytoin and subsequently on levetiracetam. An MRI of the brain showed chronic mild periventricular white matter hyperintensities but no acute findings. He was transferred to our tertiary care center on hospital day 3 for concern of nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

On examination, he was intubated and mechanically ventilated, with no abnormal general physical findings. On neurological examination, he was comatose, with intact brainstem reflexes and extensor posturing in all extremities to central stimulation. Initial laboratory work was notable for normal liver function panel, serum ammonia 120 μg/dL (reference range 65–107 μg/dL), and negative hepatitis panel, as well as respiratory alkalosis. Repeat CSF analysis showed 3 WBC/mm3 (76% neutrophils), 1 RBC/mm3, lactic acid 2.6 meq/L, total protein 28.5 mg/dL, and negative herpes simplex virus PCR as well as negative enterovirus panel, and acyclovir was discontinued. Treatment with lactulose was begun, but serum ammonia rapidly rose to 494 μg/dL within a few hours of arrival to our hospital. Rifaximin and L-carnitine were added, and emergent hemodialysis was initiated.

An MRI of the brain on day of transfer showed extensive areas of restricted diffusion with associated FLAIR hyperintensity involving bilateral temporal lobes and bilateral insular, bilateral frontal, and parietal regions in cortical and subcortical areas and diffuse mild effacement of the cerebral sulci (Figure 1), without enhancing lesions. Continuous electroencephalogram (cEEG) for a duration of 96 hours showed continuous, irregular, generalized low voltage slowing (Figure 2); however, intermittently observed facial and lip twitching did not have an electrographic correlate on cEEG. The MRI findings of symmetric grey matter involvement in the abovementioned areas, and in absence of hypoxic-ischemic insult and seizure activity, were deemed most consistent with hyperammonemic encephalopathy. The patient underwent continuous venous hemofiltration for two consecutive days followed by regular hemodialysis for two days, with sustained correction of ammonia to levels between 29 and 67 μg/dL after day 3. Liver function panel and coagulation parameters remained within normal limits. Due to poor neurological examination and concern for elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), an ICP monitor was placed, revealing three occurrences of ICP elevation to 28–30 mmHg, which were treated effectively with mannitol boluses. The patient’s nutrition was modified to a low protein, high glucose formula to avoid catabolism of endogenous protein. Two days after normalization of ammonia levels, the patient opened his eyes and started to follow commands and move his extremities, and the ICP monitor was discontinued. He was extubated on hospital day 10, at which time he was alert and conversant, without focal motor deficits, yet remained confused.

26,"A female patient born at term, weighing 2900 grams, APGAR (appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration) 9-9-10, with no prenatal history, presented neonatal pneumonia at two days of life, for which she was hospitalized for seven days, with complete recovery. The parents were apparently healthy, had no relevant medical history, and denied any blood relationship between them. She did not present intercurrences until she was two years old.

Since two years of age, the patient presented episodes of repetitive vomiting with moderate to severe dehydration, was treated in other hospitals in the country, and presented a complete recovery. Between each episode, the patient was asymptomatic and in good health.

At three years of age, the patient was admitted to the emergency room of the San Bartolomé Hospital in Lima, Peru, with a 10-hour illness, for presenting repeated vomiting, approximately 10 (1/4 cup), of food content, associated with drowsiness, with no other symptomatology. It should be noted that prior to her admission, the patient had a nutritional diagnosis of exacerbated chronic malnutrition. However, her psychomotor and neurological development were appropriate for her age.

An arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis was performed, showing metabolic acidosis. A urine test was also performed showing ketonuria 1+. Metabolic acidosis was corrected, and the patient was treated with intravenous fluids and antiemetics. During her hospitalization, bilious vomiting persisted, but less frequently. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed in another health facility, with a diagnosis of esophagitis and erosive gastritis. Likewise, brain magnetic resonance imaging with contrast with 3D spectroscopy was performed, in which no pathological findings were evidenced.

Five days after admission, the patient was found to have bradycardia and was also found to be excessively drowsy; the last episode of vomiting was recorded two days before this event. Laboratory tests were performed and showed respiratory alkalosis and low sodium and potassium levels (Table ​(Table1). Due1). Due to electrolyte disturbances, bradycardia, and excessive drowsiness, the patient was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). The patient was on mechanical ventilation for four days. During her stay in the PICU, she was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection, with a positive urine culture for Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae. In addition, a chest X-ray was performed and alveolar infiltrate was observed in the right hemithorax and left apex. In addition, clonic movements of the upper limbs were reported, so an electroencephalogram was performed, with normal results and no evidence of epileptogenic foci.

27,"The first child is a female born at 37 weeks of gestation by ventouse delivery from consanguineous parents from Pakistan. Pregnancy and delivery were uneventful. Growth parameters were normal. Early developmental milestones were age-appropriate in all domains, although she tired quickly when she first started to walk. At the age of five, she developed viral gastroenteritis. Subsequent blood tests revealed her ALT level was six times higher than the normal range (Figure 2). Subsequent ALT monitoring showed a persisting increase after the resolution of the intercurrent illness, triggering investigations for infectious, autoimmune, and metabolic etiologies. This revealed isolated plasma hypermethioninemia at 985 μmol/L (normal 10–60) and high urine methionine/creatinine ratio at 46 μmol/mmol (normal 3–10), mildly elevated plasma homocysteine level 15 μmol/L (normal 5–10), and elevation of muscle enzymes with elevated ALT 250 IU/L (normal 5–25) and high CK 1450 IU/L (normal <250). Indicators of chronic liver failure were observed, with mildly low albumin level 36 g/L (normal 37–56) and a normal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level. Notably, coagulation abnormalities, which are frequently seen in SAHH deficiency, were also present, as evidenced by a prolonged PT of 19.8 s (normal 9.6–11.8) and low fibrinogen levels of 0.8 g/L (normal 1.7–4.0) (Figure 2). Despite these biological abnormalities, the clinical examination was unremarkable. Specifically, there were no clinical signs suggesting coagulation abnormalities. Additionally, there was an absence of visceromegaly, normal muscular strength (including a negative Gowers test), and a standard neurological examination. A formal neuropsychological assessment using the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children (WISC-V) showed good motivation, concentration, and intellectual abilities in the low average range. However, she produced an uneven profile, with weaker abilities in verbal reasoning abilities (below average) and strengths in processing speed (high average).

29,"A full term, female infant was born to a G1P0 mother whose fetal ultrasound was concerning for HCM at 27 weeks gestation. The newborn had a normal clinical exam with normal muscular tone, and postnatal ECG showed mild hypertrophy of the interventricular septum (Fig. 1a). Electrocardiogram (EKG) was notable for a very short PR interval, ventricular pre-excitation, and high ventricular voltages (Fig. 1b). At 2 days of life, GAA enzyme level was low at 1.5 nmol/mg protein (normal 6–37 nmol/mg protein) on leukocyte-based assayat a local lab, urine (E)-hex-4-en-1-yl butyrate (HEX4) was elevated at 34 nmol/mol (normal <19 nmol/mol creatinine), and creatinine kinase was elevated at 2261 IU/L (normal 38–174 IU/L). Given this presentation, suspicion for IOPD was high. Biopsies of skeletal muscle and skin were obtained, and ERT with alglucosidase alfa was promptly started while waiting for biopsy results to determine CRIM status. Echocardiography at age 3 months no longer showed hypertrophy of the intraventricular septum, but the mitral valve was thickened and tethered by shortened chordae. There was moderate mitral regurgitation and subsequent moderate left ventricular dilation, for which captopril was started. The patient remained on ERT, with normalization of creatinine kinase and urine HEX4 but demonstrating failure to thrive and mild developmental delay. As the clinical picture and cardiac findings did not fit IOPD skin fibroblast GAA level using maltose as substrate was performed, which measured at 1.8 μmol/min/mg protein, which was 8.82% of the normal control (control mean = 20.4 ± 2.3 μmol/min/mg protein) and not consistent with IOPD. GAA sequencing subsequently identified a single common late-onset heterozygous mutation (c. -32-13 T > G). DNA microarray analysis was negative for a large deletion of the GAA gene in trans. Biochemical analysis of the skeletal muscle biopsy showed normal glycogen content of 0.49% (control 0.94 ± 0.55%) and low–normal GAA activity of 0.2 μmol/min/g tissue (control 0.42 ± 0.20 μmol/min/g tissue). Subsequently, blood GAA enzyme activity was tested after stopping ERT for a few months; AS it measured in the low–normal range (6.13pmo/punch/h; control = 10.88 pmol/punch/h), it further ruled out the diagnosis of Pompe disease. Light microscopic examination of skeletal muscle showed mild myopathic changes, including increased variation in fiber diameter, a mild increase in lipid, and slightly increased amounts of cytoplasmic glycogen. No rimmed vacuoles were seen, and electron microscopy found no membrane-bound glycogen, so there was no support for a lysosomal glycogen storage disorder. Given these results, the diagnosis of Pompe disease was no longer supported. Blood was sent for a commercially available HCM panel, and a heterozygous mutation in PRKAG2 (c.1423A > G p. Lys475Glu) was identified. This was a novel missense mutation predicted to be disease causing for PRKAG2 cardiac syndrome, as it leads to a nonconservative amino acid substitution, occurs at a highly conserved position in the gene, is not a known benign polymorphism, and mutations affecting nearby codons (Tyr487His and Asn488Ile) have been described as disease causing. Echocardiogram (ECG), electrocardiogram (EKG), and PRKAG2 genetic testing were normal in both parents, indicating a de novo mutation in their daughter. The patient was diagnosed with PRKAG2 cardiac syndrome with a carrier status for LOPD, and ERT was stopped at 8 months of age. Creatinine kinase and urine HEX4 levels were followed for 1 year after stopping ERT and remained normal. Follow-up ECGs continued to show thickened mitral valve leaflets with shortened chordae and moderate mitral valve regurgitation with left ventricular dilation but no ventricular hypertrophy. At 5 years of age, the child continues on captopril for afterload reduction, but she remains asymptomatic from a cardiovascular standpoint and has no overt musculoskeletal weakness per report from the treating physician.","CYT","PRKAG2",,"hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)","600858",,"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1007/s10545-017-0072-0",,,,
30,"A full-term female infant had wheezing at 5 weeks of age and failed bronchodilator therapy for presumed reactive airway disease. At 11 weeks of age, she presented with more severe wheezing at her pediatrician's office, which prompted referral to the emergency room. Chest X-ray showed severe cardiomegaly, and an ECG demonstrated severe biventricular hypertrophy, severe mitral regurgitation, and moderate tricuspid regurgitation (Fig. 2a). EKG showed biventricular hypertrophy, a short PR interval, and interventricular conduction delay (Fig. 2b). She was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit where she was started on milrinone, oxygen, and furosemide for heart failure. She developed persistent ventricular ectopy, which required a lidocaine infusion. Suspicion for IOPD was high, but blood GAA enzyme activity level was normal at 15.8 pmol/punch/h (normal ≥ 10.88 pmol/punch/h), and GAA gene sequencing and urine HEX4 were also normal. Because of the care team's experience with PRKAG2 cardiac syndrome in the patient described in case 1, this was high in the differential diagnosis. Blood was sent for a commercially available familial HCM panel, which showed a disease-causing mutation in the PRKAG2 gene (c.1592G > A p. Arg531Gln). The patient had persistent arrhythmias and poor cardiac function requiring high-dose inotropy and was therefore listed for cardiac transplant at 3 months of age. She remained in the hospital on milrinone infusion awaiting transplant, but her clinical status continued to decline. At 4 months of age, she had an episode of cardiac arrest requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) cannulation. She then developed severe renal dysfunction, a large right intracerebral hemorrhage presumably from anticoagulation required for ECMO, and was unable to recover any meaningful cardiac function. The decision was made by the family and healthcare team to withdraw support, and the patient died at 4 months of age. No muscle tissue biopsy or autopsy was performed.","CYT","PRKAG2",,"hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)","600858",,"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1007/s10545-017-0072-0",,,,
31,"A previously healthy, full-term, male infant was noted to have hypotonia, areflexia, and generalized weakness at 2 months of age. Over the next several months, he continued to show generalized weakness and developed recurrent respiratory infections with frequent hospital admissions. Evaluation during these admissions showed creatinine kinase mildly elevated at 197 IU/L (normal 38–174 IU/L) and blood GAA enzyme level (done at the local facility) was low at 4.81 U (18.66-U control sample). ECG showed mild hypertrophy of the interventricular septum but an otherwise normal left ventricular mass. EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm without evidence of pre-excitation or hypertrophy. Due to his persistent hypotonia, muscle weakness, and low GAA enzyme level, he was diagnosed with nonclassic IOPD at 11 months of age and started on ERT with alglucosidase alfa After just 3 months of ERT, the patient showed significant improvement in motor skills; he could crawl well, sit unassisted, and pull to a standing position—none of which he could do prior to starting ERT. At 2.5 years of age, he had a normal gait and could jump and climb stairs. The previously noted hypertrophy of the interventricular septum resolved, and he had no abnormalities on ECG or EKG. Given the patient's unusual course and atypical presentation for IOPD, additional testing was performed at 2.5 years of age. GAA enzyme testing on skin fibroblasts was normal at 50.7 nmol/h/mg (control 45–180 nmol/h/mg). GAA gene sequencing identified a heterozygous mutation (c. -32-13 T > G), consistent with being a carrier of LOPD. Parental testing showed the same heterozygous mutation in his mother and no abnormalities in his father. These new data no longer supported a diagnosis of IOPD, and ERT was discontinued. To identify the true cause of his myopathy, further testing was performed. At age 3, he underwent a quadriceps muscle biopsy that showed mild myopathic features on light microscopy, including increased variation in fiber size, focal myocyte degeneration, a mild increase in cytoplasmic glycogen and other intermyofibrillar material, and subsarcolemmal blebs of uncertain composition. No rimmed vacuoles were seen, and electron microscopy showed no membrane-bound glycogen, which argued against a lysosomal glycogen storage disease. Finally, a glycogen storage disease sequencing panel showed a pathogenic mutation in PRKAG2 (c. 298G > A p. Gly100Ser), a known disease-causing mutation. The patient, now 7 years old, was restarted on ERT just before his fourth birthday due to worsening muscle weakness when off ERT. He continues to make progress in gross motor skills and has some fine motor delays, but there is no further evidence of HCM or pre-excitation.","CYT","PRKAG2",,"hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)","600858",,"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1007/s10545-017-0072-0",,,,
32,"The patient was seen for the first time at the age of 9 years as an outpatient in the division of paediatric cardiology. The boy’s somatic development was normal, but his speech and intellectual development were slightly below age-appropriate limits, prompting special schooling. According to his mother he showed sweating and dyspnoea at exertion, but was otherwise asymptomatic. Auscultation revealed a split first heart sound and a rough systolic ejection murmur over the third left intercostal space. Blood pressure was 105/57. The electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm, incomplete right bundle branch block, and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy; echocardiography disclosed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, leading to the diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Due to further progression of the cardiomyopathy with mitral valve insufficiency, massive hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy affecting both ventricles, and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, the boy was listed for heart transplantation, which was performed at the age of 12.6 years. A muscle biopsy was performed prior to transplantation. Biochemical investigations of the muscle tissue revealed normal activities excluding disorders of the mitochondrial energy metabolism. The possibility of Danon disease was substantiated by immunohistochemistry. Almost 2 years after transplantation the boy did not show episodes of organ rejection. Ophthalmic examination revealed myopia, peripheral pigmentary retinopathy, and lenticular opacities as described recently in Danon disease.","CYT","LAMP2",,"Danon disease","300257",,"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1007/s10545-009-1097-9",,,,
33,"The patient, a Hispanic boy now 8 years old, was referred to a neurologist at 21months of age because of developmental delay. He was a 4.3 kg product of a full-termgestation delivered via spontaneous vaginal delivery to a 32-year-old Honduran whosepregnancy was complicated by varicella during the third trimester. Parents are ofNicaraguan and Honduran ancestry; they are not consanguineous. He has an olderbrother and sister who are normal and there was one second-trimester spontaneousmiscarriage. The mother reports that at birth he held his hands in a clasped position,but he ate and grew well during the first year of life. He began to smile and roll overat 3 months, sat independently at 7 months and crawled at 12 months of age. Hestood without support at 1518 months but was never able to walk withoutassistance. At 21 months of age he was examined by a paediatric neurologist andfound to be at the 5th centile for weight, length and head circumference. He was alertand attentive and babbled but did not have intelligible words. Cranial nerve exam-ination was notable for hypoplastic optic nerves and abnormal visual behaviour.He had mild truncal hypotonia and decreased strength in the extremities. Deep tendonreflexes were normal. He could bear weight on his legs, but he could not walk. At 24months of age he began to have regression in his developmental milestones, with lossof the ability to sit alone and crawl, and at 3 years of age he lost the ability to controlhis head. At 3½ years of age he began having seizures, occurring about five times perday and each lasting about 15 s. A video EEG revealed myoclonic seizures related togeneralized sharp waves and slowed background activity. Brainstem auditory evokedpotentials were normal. Tibial nerve evoked potentials revealed slowed conduction.Visual evoked response established cortical blindness. At 6 years of age he was referred to Texas Children’s Hospital because his seizure frequency had increased to about one per hour while being treated with clonazepam 0.04 mg/kg per day. Hisweight, length and head circumference were all less than the 5th centile. He sat ina customized wheelchair designed to support his head and hold him in a sittingposition. He did not visually fixon objects and was not attentive to the examiner.He had minimal response to his environment. He had a grade II/VI systolic murmurand atrophic musculature in his extremities; otherwise his general physical examin-ation was unremarkable; he was nondysmorphic. Neurological examination wasremarkable for left esotropia with pale optic disks. Tone was decreased throughout,with the exception of increased tone at the ankles. Deep tendon reflexes were 1=4and symmetric; the Achilles tendon reflexes were absent. There was an extensorresponse on plantar stimulation.He was found to have 3-hydroxy-2-methylbutyric acid and tiglyglycine in urineorganic acid analysis. 3-Ketothiolase enzyme activity performed on cultured skin¢broblasts was normal (9.8 nmol/min per mg protein; reference range 5.615.9),as was succinyl-CoA 3-ketotransferase enzyme activity. Acylcarnitine pro¢le wasnormal, with no increase in either pentanoylcarnitine or pentenoylcarnitine.

34,"Born in 1993, this girl was the third child of nonconsanguineous and healthy parents; she was delivered after 38 weeks of gestation without complications. The birth weight, length, and head circumference were close to the 50th percentile. Growth was normal for age. She could, however, not sit alone before the age of 15 months and could not walk alone until 24 months. At that age, she spoke only one word. An episode of lethargy and enteritis occurred after a protein-rich and fatty meal. Psychomotor and speech development are delayed despite the slow but continuous acquisition of developmental milestones. At 7 years of age, funduscopy and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain were normal, with the exception of mild frontoparietal cortical atrophy. An electroencephalogram showed diffuse β-activity without signs of hypersynchronous activity. The initial diagnostic workup showed elevated excretions of 3-hydroxy-2-methylbutyric acid (3H2MBA), 2-ethylhydracrylic acid (2EHA), and tiglylglycine (TG; Table 1), indicating a possible defect of isoleucine catabolism. After informed parental consent was obtained, an oral isoleucine loading test (100mg/kg of body weight) was performed, demonstrating a marked increase in urinary 3H2MBA and TG excretion (Fig). 2-Methylacetoacetic acid was not detected. Over a period of 5 years, the biochemical phenotype remained constant. In cultured fibroblasts, the activity of 3-ketothiolase was normal, as was 3H2MBD activity measured initially in a research laboratory. After the first report of a patient with 3H2MBD deficiency,4 fibroblasts were reexamined in the same laboratory that identified the enzyme defect in the patient described by Zschocke and colleagues.4 The results shown in Table 1 are consistent with a diagnosis of 3H2MBD deficiency. Regardless of the first set of normal enzyme activities, the natural protein intake was reduced to 1 to 1.5g/kg each day as a precaution, a regimen similar to the treatment of patients with 3-ketothiolase deficiency. After the diagnosis was made, isoleucine intake was further reduced to 30mg/kg each day, equivalent to a daily natural protein intake of 0.7g/kg. An isoleucine-free amino acid mixture (ISO-AM 2; SHS, Heilbronn, Germany) was added to increase the total daily protein intake to 1.4g/kg each day. Within several weeks, a reduction of 3H2MBA and TG excretion was observed (Table 2). Clinically, the patient appears to be more alert and active.","CYT","3H2MBD",,"3-hydroxy-2-methylbutyryl-coa dehydrogenase deficiency","not found",,"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ana.10169",,,,
35,"This boy, born in 1993, was the product of an uncomplicated 38-week gestation, the first child of nonconsanguineous and healthy parents. The birth weight, length, and head circumference were on the 75th, 90th, and 25th percentiles, respectively. Developmental milestones were reached adequately during the 1st year of life. At 14 months of age, the parents noticed developmental regression, including loss of vocalization and deterioration of visual function. His appetite decreased, and he started to vomit frequently. At that time, the weight and head circumference were on the 3rd percentile, and the length was on the 50th percentile. Ataxia was evident. He could stand only with support, and targeted grasping was impossible. He was not able to focus on objects or follow them. Ophthalmologic investigation showed a pigmentary retinopathy-like fundus appearance and normal optic discs. Brain magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalograms, auditory-evoked potentials, and nerve conduction studies were normal. Urinary organic acid analysis showed mild lactic aciduria and elevated excretions of 3H2MBA, 3-hydroxyisobutyric acid, 2EHA and TG, which were suggestive of a defect in the isoleucine degradation pathway (see Table 1). 2-Methylacetoacetate was not detected. Informed consent was obtained for all investigations. Protein restriction to 1g/kg of body weight per day was initiated. In cultured fibroblasts, normal 3-ketothiolase and 3H2MBD activities were obtained. Over the following years, the retinal and neurological manifestations were progressive. Funduscopy showed steadily increasing signs of complex pigmentary retinal degeneration and optic atrophy bilaterally. Progressive loss of motor and mental skills became evident. At the age of 4¼ years, brain magnetic resonance imaging showed severe cerebral atrophy and occipital infarctions. Lactate levels intermittently increased (see Table 1), and Leigh syndrome was suspected. In muscle, a mild reduction of respiratory chain complex I activity was measured (0.09U/g, normal 0.35 ± 0.14; 0.01U/U relative to citrate synthase, normal 0.023 ± 0.009). Protein restriction was discontinued. At the age of 5 years, 8 months, he developed epileptic seizures that became difficult to control. Because of the persistent urinary metabolite pattern, a reevaluation of enzyme activity in fibroblasts was performed at the age of 6 years, 10 months, yielding now clear-cut 3H2MBD deficiency (see Table 1). The boy is now 7 years old and suffers from severe mental and physical retardation with rarely any spontaneous movements and profound muscle hypotonia. He reacts poorly to external stimuli. Echocardiographic studies showed marked concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle with still normal systolic function. After only a few weeks of an isoleucine-restricted diet (30mg/kg each day), no changes in symptoms or behavior were noticed. The amount of urinary 3H2MBA, however, decreased (see Table 2). Urine organic acid analyses were performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and plasma acylcarnitine analyses were performed by tandem mass spectrometry. The assay of 3H2MBD activity in cultured fibroblasts was first done in a research laboratory and was later repeated in the Laboratory for Genetic Metabolic Disease at the University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands. This assay was performed spectrophotometrically at 37°C in the reverse direction after the reduction of 2-methylacetoacetyl-CoA to 3-hydroxy-2-methylbutyryl-CoA with a decrease in NADH absorbance at 340nm. The reaction medium contained the following components: 100mM MES buffer (pH 6.5), 0.1mM NADH, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.1mg of fibroblast protein/ml, and 100μM 2-methylacetoacetyl-CoA.","CYT","3H2MBD",,"3-hydroxy-2-methylbutyryl-coa dehydrogenase deficiency","not found",,"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ana.10169",,,,
36,"A girl, the fourth child of consanguineous parents (first cousins), was born at 38 weeks of gestation after a pregnancy complicated by polyhydramnios. Birth weight was 2180 g (< 3rd percentile), length 47 cm (∼10th percentile), head circumference 30 cm (< 3rd percentile), and APGAR score 8/9. One brother, born at term, and one premature sister, had both died 6 h(presumed perinatal asphyxia) and two days (cause not reported), respectively, after birth. Ultrasound images of the fourth child showed agenesis of the corpus callosum and mild bilateral pyelocaliceal dilatation. At physical examination, dysmorphic features were noted, such as hypertelorism, overriding sutures, hooked nose, micrognathia, camptodactyly of the fifth finger, single transverse palmar crease on the left hand and postaxial polydactyly on the right hand. Immediately after birth and during the following 17 days, she presented with hypoglycemic episodes difficult to control (glucose: 20–40 mg/dl). Laboratory exams, performed during one of these episodes, showed lactic acidemia (4.0 µmol/ml; N: 0.7–2.5 µmol/ml), mild hyperammonemia,– and marked metabolic acidosis (pH 7.20; pCO2 25.1 mmHg; HCO3- 9.6 mEq/L; BE -17.5 mEq/L). Neurologic exam, performed at 4 days of life, showed incomplete Moro reflex, posture of limbs flexion, reduced axial tonus, and slightly elevated appendicular tonus. At 6 days of life, antibiotics were administered for one week due to suspicion of sepsis. On the seventh and 25th days, two samples of urine and one of plasma were collected and sent for inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) screening. Amino acid analyses were carried out on a Biochrom 20 (Biochrom Ltd., Cambridge, UK) amino acid analyzer. Sample preparation and analysis were performed according to the manufacturer’s standard protocols. General aminoaciduria was observed and some plasma amino acids were also altered (Table 1). Urinary organic acid analyses by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) (according to Tanaka et al 1980) showed massive excretion of fumaric acid (> 232 mmol/mol creatinine, normal range < 45 mmol/mol creatinine). The same result was presented by a new urine sample collected at 40 days of life. At 1 month of age, despite breast feeding and normal sucking, the baby had extreme difficulty gaining weight, remaining undernourished due to persistent vomiting and occasional diarrhea. Cholestatic jaundice and hepatomegaly were noted since birth. At 40 days of life, the following hepatic enzymes were altered: [aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 137 U/L, N 10–34 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 78 U/L, N 5–35 U/L; alkaline leukocyte phosphatase (ALP) 267 U/L, N 20–140 U/L, and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (γ–GT) 505 U/L, N 0–51 U/L]. Further exams at this period revealed colpocephaly [cranial computed tomography (CT)], infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis [abdominal ultrasound (US)] and interatrial communication (ECO). At one-and-a-half months of age, pyloromyotomy was performed, but vomiting episodes persisted. At this time, she still presented with lactic acidemia (5.0 µmol/ml), metabolic acidosis, and mild hyperammonemia. Hemotransfusion was performed due to anemia. At 2 months and 4 days, hemoculture was positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis, and she was treated with antibiotics for 14 days. There was a small weight gain, but hepatic enzymes remained altered. At 3 months and 5 days, the girl was discharged but continued to gain weight slowly, although being fed with breast milk and supplementary formula. Vomiting episodes twice a day and occasional diarrhea persisted. At 4 months and 9 days, she was readmitted owing to vomiting with traces of blood, hyperpyrexia, intense crying and pallor, dyspnea, and dehydration. Besides hepatosplenomegaly, she presented with severe metabolic acidosis (pH 6.45; pCO2 32 mmHg; HCO3– 2 mEq/L; BE –32 mEq/L) and bradycardia, which evolved to cardiac arrest and death. It was not possible to measure enzymatic activity and perform molecular analysis, since no laboratory in Brazil executed these exams. Postmortem exam was not allowed by the parents.","CYT","FH",,"Fumaric aciduria","136850",,"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1007/s10545-010-9134-2",,,,

38,"The reported cases were two Han Chinese patients born to non-consanguineous parents, who also have another two healthy girls. The birth history for both the sisters included full-term pregnancy with normal delivery, and they were breast-fed and given a normal infant diet. The family history was unremarkable for any related diseases.The parents noticed a pronounced developmental delay and slow response, when the girls were about 3 years old. They were examined in the local hospital, with no significant positive findings. In the elder sister, the symptoms worsened, gradually causing joint pain and hindering gait coordination. The younger sister's condition was more serious; it manifested with obstinacy, grumpiness, aggression, change in character and paranoia. She refused to take food and change clothes, had sleep problems (nightmares), and had shortness of breath. Both the sisters did not have a history of convulsions, dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting and changes in skin or hair colour, or urinary odour. Accompanied by their parents, the sisters sought help from many hospitals but with no positive results on routine tests. Six years later, the sisters had no alternative but to be treated for ‘epilepsy’ or ‘hyperactivity behaviour’. They had to drop out from school. After that, the younger sister was suspected as having schizophrenia and was placed on risperidone 1 mg and trihexane 2 mg, once daily. Because of little improvement of her symptoms, her parents increased her dose of risperidone to 1.5 mg, twice daily. The elder sister did not receive any treatment during that period. In April 2011, both the sisters underwent MRI of the brain. MRI of the elder sister showed moderate-sized areas of hyperintensity, bilaterally in the parieto-occipital periventricular white matter. In the MRI of younger sister, there were similar small areas of hyperintensity in the same regions. At the same time, an MR angiography of the brain was performed for the younger sister and no abnormality was found. Based on these findings the two sisters had been diagnosed as having hereditary leukodystrophy and were treated with neurotrophic drugs and vitamins, but with suboptimal outcomes. Then they came to our hospital. The elder sister was 12 years old, 159 cm in height, and 38 kg in weight, expressionless and unresponsive to stimuli. The younger sister was 10 years old, 126 cm in height, and 35 kg in weight, obstinate, grumpy and uncooperative, with a fearful expression. Both the sisters had normal muscle tone and tendon reflexes, normal hair and skin colour, and their urines were without any peculiar odour. The remainder of the physical examination, including physical examination of the heart, chest, abdomen, external genital organs, etc, was unremarkable. Routine blood, urine and stool studies were normal. Liver function tests, kidney function tests, thyroid studies, electrolyte panel and lipoprotein tests were all within normal limits. ECG, abdominal ultrasound and X-ray of the chest showed no abnormalities. Sleeping EEGs showed mild-to-moderate abnormalities (a little unusual paroxysmal rhythm with middle–high amplitude in the frontal hemisphere). Ferric chloride test was positive, and the Matsumoto Institute of Life Science (MILS) international test showed that the phenylalanine in the urine exceeded the normal concentration range. The urine catecholamine and blood phenylalanine concentration (performed with MILS tandem mass spectrometry) was abnormally high, while the serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and blood tyrosine concentration (performed with MILS tandem mass spectrometry) was normal After treatment with strict dietary restriction of phenylalanine for 20 days, the characteristic pattern of urinary pterins and the activity of dihydropteridine reductase () in the red blood cells of the younger sister were both normal, while the elder sister did not undergo above tests due to the lack of a valid specimen. ","JAM","PAH",,"Phenylketonuria (PKU)","261600",,"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3794122/",,,,
39,"A 51-day-old male infant presented with poor sucking, abdominal distension, and testicular edema. He was the first child of non-consanguineous parents. His father was healthy and his mother had a history of atrial septal defect. He was born without complications at 39 weeks and 6 days, was 50 cm (+0.49 standard deviation (SD)) in length, and weighed 3168 g (+0.38 SD). Newborn mass screening (NBS) using tandem mass spectrometry revealed no abnormalities. He was referred to a local general hospital owing to the development of ascites, liver atrophy, and liver tumor (Supplemental data 1A), and was suspected of liver failure resulting from an inherited metabolic disorder. He received mitochondrial rescue therapy including vitamin B1, carnitine, and coenzyme Q10. Moreover, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), antithrombin III, albumin, and vitamin K were administered because of a coagulation disorder. However, treatment for liver failure and the coagulation disorder did not lead to a significant improvement. The patient was transferred to our institution because of the need for LT. He appeared sick, presented with drowsiness, and was jaundiced with the following vital signs: body temperature, 39.7 °C; blood pressure, 140/125 mmHg; respiratory rate, 35 breaths/min; pulse, 190 bpm at a regular cardiac rhythm; and oxygen saturation, 90% with oxygen at 2 L/min. Subcutaneous hemorrhage and purple spots were seen scattered from the hypogastric region to the scrotum. He was intubated and his breathing was managed with a ventilator. Laboratory tests revealed anemia (hemoglobin: 7.1 g/dL), thrombocytopenia (platelets: 9.6 × 104/μL), hypoproteinemia (total protein: 4.6 g/dL), and coagulopathy (prothrombin time (PT): 32.6 s (reference: 11.0–15.2 s), PT-international normalized ratio: 2.73 and activated partial thromboplastin time: 51.4 s (reference: 25.2–35.2 s)). Liver function tests revealed unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin: 3.2 mg/dL, direct bilirubin: 0.8 mg/dL). The blood alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level was very high (196,931.0 ng/mL). Administration of FFP, antithrombin III, albumin, and vitamin K was continued. The patient underwent combination therapy with PE and CHDF, and ascitic fluid was removed using continuous drainage (Fig. 1). Moreover, he received antibiotic therapy with aminobenzylpenicillin and clindamycin following ceftriaxone sodium hydrate and vancomycin hydrochloride owing to Staphylococcus agalactiae or group B Streptococcus infection in the blood. Urine organic acid analysis demonstrated significantly increased levels of SA and tyrosine metabolites (p-hydroxyphenyl lactic acid [PHPLA] and p-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid [PHPPA]). Moreover, the analysis revealed increased levels of lactic acid, pyruvic acid, phenyllactic acid, phenylpyruvic acid, and phenylacetic acid. Blood amino acids analysis showed increased methionine (448.0 μmol/L [reference value: 18.9–40.5 μmol/L]), tyrosine (205.9 μmol/L [reference value: 40.4–90.3 μmol/L]), and phenylalanine (115.2 μmol/L [reference control: 42.6–75.7 μmol/L]) levels. He was diagnosed with HT1 and received NTBC (2 mg/kg/day) and tyrosine- and phenylalanine-free formula. NTBC treatment lowered blood AFP levels (36,252.0 ng/mL and 11,386.0 ng/mL at 2 days and 6 days after NTBC treatment, respectively). However, the coagulation disorder showed no signs of improvement. The liver mass in segment VI showed a tendency to expand, and other multiple masses appeared in the liver. He underwent living donor LT from his mother and was recovered from ALF. Blood gene analysis revealed compound heterozygous mutations NM_000137.4(FAH):c.782C > T (p.Pro261Leu) (a previously reported pathogenic variant allele), c.565G > A (p.Val189Ile), and c.688C > G (p.Leu230Val) (novel likely pathogenic variant) in FAH. In addition, NM_000137.4(FAH):c.565G > A (p.Val189Ile) (a previously reported likely nonpathogenic allele) was also identified (Fig. 2). The patient was definitively diagnosed with HT1. After receiving LT, the NTBC dose was gradually decreased. Since the urine SA was positive once the administration of NTBC was discontinued and renal tubulopathy was not present, a small dose of NTBC (0.15 mg/kg/day) was continued, leading to negative urine SA. At the age of 2 years, his developmental quotient (DQ) on the Enjoji Scale of Infant Analytical Development was normal (motor DQ: 110, sociality DQ: 98, and language DQ: 90). At age of 3 years and 6 months, the plasma tyrosine and phenylalanine levels were 623.0 and 59.1 μmol/L, respectively, while he received NTBC treatment (0.15 mg/kg/day) without restriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine intake. At the age of 5 years and 7 months, he has a stable life without kidney disease, impaired intelligence and growth (height: 107.0 cm (−0.77 SD), weight: 19.0 kg (+0.12 SD)).","JAM","FAH",,"Tyrosinemia type I (HT-1)","276700",,"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9254452/",,,,
40,"She was born without complications at 40 weeks and 3 days of gestation, was 50 cm (+0.77 SD) in length, and weighed 3656 g (+1.60 SD). The SA level in the amniotic fluid at 16 weeks' gestation was 0.13 μmol/L (ten times less than those of patients with HT1, although ten times higher than those of healthy controls). The infant was treated at the neonatal intensive care unit for neonatal hypoglycemia and discharged at the age of 7 days. NBS showed mildly increased methionine levels in the dried blood spots. Postnatal urine examination for organic acids did not show increased SA levels and blood tests revealed no abnormalities (Supplemental data 2). She was considered an obligate carrier of HT1 because she did not present any signs or symptoms related to HT1 at the age of 2 months. She achieved normal growth and development after 7 months of routine medical examination.At the age of 9 months, the child was brought to a local general hospital because of changes in skin color and rashes. Blood tests showed mild liver disorder (aspartate aminotransferase, 61 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase, 41 IU/L; lactate dehydrogenase, 418 IU/L; γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, 134 IU/L; cholinesterase, 191 IU/L; type IV collagen, 607 ng/mL; hyaluronic acid, 100 ng/mL; and AFP: 8349 ng/mL), hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol: 292 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: 188 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol: 58 mg/dL, triglyceride: 100 mg/dL), and elevated methionine (254.1 μmol/L) and tyrosine (464.9 μmol/L) levels. Ultrasonography revealed a regenerating 14-mm nodule-like mass. She visited our hospital again with suspected HT1. She did not develop jaundice, hyperammonemia, coagulation disorder, or electrolyte imbalance. Abdominal ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced MRI revealed dull edges and irregular rough surfaces of the liver, which indicated the possibility of hepatic cirrhosis. Multiple masses in the liver were considered regenerating nodules (Supplemental data 1B and 3). The patient was clinically diagnosed with HT1 and received NTBC treatment (1 mg/kg/day). Urine organic analysis revealed high levels of PHPLA, PHPPA, and succinyl acetoacetate. At 10 days and 2 months after NTBC treatment, the AFP level was ameliorated to 2380 ng/mL and 82.4 ng/mL. The NTBC dose was increased to 12 mg/day (2 mg/kg/ day) from the first dose of 4 mg/day (1 mg/kg/day). She was definitively diagnosed with HT1 owing to the detection of the same mutations in the FAH gene as her brother (Fig. 2). At the age of 2 years and 6 months, she has a stable life without kidney injury, developmental delay, or growth delay (height: 88.5 cm (+0.04 SD), weight: 13.5 kg (0.96 SD)).

46,"A 34-year-old female, first visited our clinic at the age of 5 in 1989. Previous clinical records until 1992 are unavailable, but a summary indicated congenital nystagmus. She had been diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa and hyperopia at another clinic and had been wearing glasses since age 3. At her initial visit to our clinic, hyperopia was confirmed. Fundus photographs from that time revealed symmetrical inferior-dominant retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) mottling without bone spicule pigmentation. By 1992, her best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 0.05 (S +6.0) in the right eye and 0.06 (S +5.0) in the left. She had horizontal nystagmus and photophobia and failed the panel D15 test. Anomaloscope testing in 1996 was unmeasurable. By 1998, her bright-flash electroretinography (ERG) was severely attenuated, and 30 Hz flicker ERG was non-recordable in both eyes. At her final clinic visit in 2019, her BCVA had declined to 0.02 (uncorrectable) in the right eye and 0.03 (uncorrectable) in the left. Over the years, fundus photographs documented progressive retinal degeneration and the development of bone spicule pigmentation. Although visual field assessments suggested steady afferent constriction, nystagmus complicated measurements. Autofluorescence imaging revealed donut-shaped retinal degeneration in both eyes. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) performed in 2015 showed that the outer nuclear layer (ONL), ellipsoid zone (EZ), and interdigitation zone (IZ) were preserved in the foveal area, though the preserved region was smaller compared to her sibling.

Birth history was uneventful, but one sibling died due to the same condition. Second-degree consanguinity was documented between the parents. On initial assessment, the patient was lethargic and dehydrated with marked Kussmaul breathing. Blood gas analysis revealed metabolic acidosis (pH 7.22, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) 14.6 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3; 5.9 mmol/l) with a high anion gap (20.7 mmol/l) and an increased base excess (-19.1 mmol/l). Computed tomography (CT) chest showed bilateral ground-glass appearance (infective) (Figure 1), complete blood count (CBC) showed a high total leukocyte count (TLC) of 37, mostly neutrophil (60%), and her C-reactive protein (CRP) was 1.56 mg/dl. The results of the biochemical analysis were within normal limits (ammonia 37 umol/l). Ketonuria was also present (ketone 3+ / 300 mg/dl). The patient was suspected to have bronchopneumonia with concern for underlying metabolic disorder. The patient was initiated on antibiotic ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg/day. Repeat arterial blood gas (ABG) revealed continued metabolic acidosis and the patient was initiated on a continuous bicarbonate infusion. Subsequent ABGs after the infusion of bicarbonate showed an improvement in her metabolic acidosis. Plasma amino acids and urine for organic acids were sent to evaluate for underlying metabolic disorders. The patient was also initiated on oral sodium bicarbonate, biotin, vitamin B12, and protein-free milk, and mother's milk was stopped after consultation with the chemical pathologist.

The patient, born prematurely at 29 weeks and showing slight growth retardation, has no history of fever or conjunctivitis. Her mother has a history of chronic urticaria, arthralgias, and deafness, while her father and 11-year-old brother are healthy. Laboratory evaluations revealed elevated white blood cell count, high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Other tests, including liver and renal function, were normal. Skin biopsy showed nonspecific inflammation consistent with common urticaria. Chronic urticaria was diagnosed, and systemic antihistamines were prescribed, with inconsistent results. At age 5, the patient presented with severe headache, and further investigation, including MRI and lumbar puncture, confirmed intracranial hypertension and bilateral papillary edema. Suspecting an autoinflammatory condition, genetic testing identified a T348M mutation in the NLRP3/CIAS1 gene, confirming Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS). The patient began daily subcutaneous anakinra (2 mg/kg), which quickly resolved her symptoms. CRP and ESR normalized within a month, and her intracranial hypertension improved after three months, allowing discontinuation of additional medication.

79,"A 3-year-old boy presented with recurrent fevers of unknown origin, persisting over 10 months with episodes lasting 1–5 days every 15 days. Fever temperatures were generally around 37.5ºC, occasionally reaching up to 39ºC, and were accompanied by bilateral conjunctival congestion and an urticarial-like rash. No other symptoms, such as fatigue, respiratory or gastrointestinal issues, or joint pain, were noted.

Laboratory tests indicated elevated leukocyte and neutrophil counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and serum amyloid protein (SAA) levels. Whole exome sequencing revealed a heterozygous missense variation in the NLRP3 gene (p.R262W), which was identified as a spontaneous, likely pathogenic mutation (validated by PolyPhen-2 and MutationTaster).

80,"A 25-year-old white male presents with a history of recurrent urticaria, fevers, and progressive hearing loss since birth. Physical examination reveals multiple blanchable erythematous patches on the face, trunk, and extremities. Laboratory tests show normal CBC, CMP, and complement levels, but elevated CRP and ESR. A punch biopsy of an urticarial lesion reveals perivascular and interstitial dermatitis with neutrophils. Genetic testing confirms a mutation in the NLRP3 gene. The patient is enrolled in an investigational study and has been symptom-free since starting daily subcutaneous injections of the IL-1 receptor antagonist, anakinra. The patient is diagnosed with Mucklee-Wells syndrome (MWS), a hereditary periodic fever syndrome classified as a cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS). This rare autosomal dominant disorder is characterized by recurrent urticaria, fever, chills, headaches, myalgias, and arthralgias, with episodes triggered by cold, heat, fatigue, or stress. Progressive nerve damage leads to hearing loss, often by the second decade of life, while amyloid deposits can cause renal damage in one-third of patients. The NLRP3 gene mutation results in a hyperactive cryopyrin protein, leading to an inappropriate inflammatory response and excessive IL-1 release, contributing to recurrent fevers and tissue damage. Diagnosis is based on clinical features (recurrent fever, urticaria, sensorineural deafness) and laboratory findings (elevated ESR, CRP, IL-6, and serum amyloid protein). Anakinra has shown efficacy in reducing inflammation and may reverse hearing loss and amyloidosis, underscoring the role of IL-1 in the pathogenesis of MWS.","FKM","NLRP8","yes","Muckle-Wells syndrome","191905","575.0","Muckle–Wells syndrome: A case report - Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology

81,"A female patient who exhibited symptoms from early childhood. At three years old, she had a mild squint, though nystagmus was not initially observed. By age five, she developed recurrent otitis media on the right side, which eventually led to complete deafness in that ear. At six years, prior to corrective eye surgery, nystagmus was noted for the first time. Despite extensive evaluations, including four-vessel arteriography and air encephalography, no significant findings emerged, and a preliminary diagnosis of congenital nystagmus was made.

Starting in her mid-20s, the patient experienced bi-weekly episodes of dysarthria (slurred speech), ataxia, and vertigo, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, headache, and drowsiness post-episode. Each episode had a sudden onset, lasting between two and 24 hours, with exercise being a potential trigger. At 26, she was re-evaluated due to the increasing frequency of episodes, sometimes occurring up to five times per week. Examination showed spontaneous nystagmus in all directions and disturbances in pursuit, optokinetic responses, and rotation responses, characteristic of cerebellar involvement. Audiological testing showed total hearing loss on the right, with normal responses on the left. Neurological tests like EEG and visual evoked responses were unremarkable, and MRI revealed atrophy in the superior cerebellar vermis. A provisional diagnosis of basilar migraine was initially made.

However, following a slight elevation in creatine kinase and further evaluations, a final diagnosis of familial paroxysmal ataxia was established. Treatment with acetazolamide (250 mg twice daily) led to a significant reduction in attacks over eight months.","FKM","CACNA1A","yes","Familial paroxysmal ataxia","108500","97.0","Familial paroxysmal ataxia: report of a family - PMC

As he grew older, minor mental retardation became evident, along with early-life articulation difficulties. At six years old, he exhibited numerous café-au-lait spots and slight clumsiness in his left arm, though no signs of neurofibromatosis were found. Neurological assessments revealed a mild squint with nystagmus and jerky saccades during horizontal gaze. EEG tests showed increased slow-wave activity, although brain CT scans were normal.

The provisional epilepsy diagnosis led to further treatment with sodium valproate, which did not significantly affect the episodes, which continued approximately every six weeks.

84,"A case of a 14-year-old boy diagnosed with argininosuccinic aciduria (ASA), a urea cycle disorder, highlighted by a hyperammonemic crisis and compound heterozygous mutations in the ASL gene. Initially, he had a delayed psychomotor development post-infancy and struggled with physical activities and protein-rich foods. By age 14, he was managing daily activities and simple academic tasks but was hospitalized following an influenza infection, which led to severe hyperammonemia and encephalopathy. Upon admission, his ammonia levels were dangerously elevated (849 μg/dL, peaking at 3286 μg/dL). Treatment included arginine and sodium benzoate for ammonia detoxification and continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF), which promptly reduced ammonia levels. Methylprednisolone and mannitol were administered to manage brain edema. Following recovery, his plasma amino acids showed elevated citrulline and reduced arginine and ornithine, consistent with ASA. Elevated argininosuccinic acid in both serum and urine further confirmed the diagnosis. Genetic testing revealed two mutations in the ASL gene, solidifying the diagnosis. After a 20-day hospital stay, he was discharged with a regimen of a low-protein diet and oral arginine supplements, later including sodium phenylbutyrate. MRI showed initial brain edema and bilateral thalamus signal changes, which partially resolved. The patient's neurological baseline remained stable post-crisis, with no further hyperammonemic episodes up to age 17. This case emphasizes the importance of metabolic and genetic evaluation in delayed developmental cases with hyperammonemia, enabling targeted treatments and dietary modifications to prevent future crises.","FKM","ASL","yes","argininosuccinic aciduria","207900","23.0","Late-onset argininosuccinic aciduria associated with hyperammonemia triggered by influenza infection in an adolescent: A case report - PMC

By day seven, he was admitted for neonatal sepsis, conjunctivitis, and jaundice, exhibiting lethargy, poor responsiveness, and ocular hyperemia with purulent eye secretions. Initially treated with intravenous dextrose and antibiotics for suspected sepsis, the patient’s condition deteriorated within a day, progressing to hypotonia and coma. Serum analysis revealed elevated ammonia levels (hyperammonemia), reaching 568 μmol/L. Tandem Mass Spectrometry identified abnormal amino acid levels, including elevated citrulline. He was subsequently treated with amikacin and arginine to reduce ammonia levels, which stabilized after several days, allowing for discharge on the ninth hospital day. Post-discharge, he was managed with a low-protein diet, oral arginine, and sodium benzoate, maintaining serum ammonia below 80 μmol/L. At four years, his physical development was appropriate, though language and motor skills were slightly delayed compared to peers. Family history showed a normal, unaffected older sister. Genetic testing, following informed consent, involved next-generation sequencing (NGS) of blood samples, targeting urea cycle-related genes.

100,"A 17-year-old girl diagnosed with a carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS I) deficiency at age 3 presented in November 2007 with lethargy and a blood ammonia concentration of 305 μg/dL, following recurrent acute attacks characterized by somnolence, ataxia, coordination defects, and cognitive disturbances despite a strict dietary regimen. After a 72-hour infusion of sodium benzoate and arginine, her condition stabilized, and cerebral MRI results were normal. Due to the persistent risk of acute episodes and poor quality of life, orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) was proposed and agreed upon by the patient and her family. After being placed on the pediatric waiting list at the Bologna Liver Transplantation Center, she underwent OLT two months later, with an uneventful post-operative recovery and rapid normalization of ammonia levels.

101,"A two-month-old asymptomatic male was referred to the outpatient clinic due to low citrulline levels and a high glutamine-to-citrulline ratio identified through expanded newborn screening. He was born at 39 weeks via cesarean section from healthy nonconsanguineous parents, with normal birth weight (3.510 kg) and length (51 cm). Family history was significant for the sudden death of an older brother at 18 months from severe hyperammonemia and a maternal aunt who died at two years. Biochemical analysis revealed persistent hyperammonemia (138.1 μmol/L), elevated levels of glycine, alanine, ornithine, and glutamine, decreased citrulline, and increased urinary orotic acid, raising suspicion for ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency. Genetic testing confirmed a hemizygous mutation in exon 6 of the OTC gene (c.622G>A, p.A208T).

102,"The patient was a 72‐year‐old Caucasian male, born from non‐consanguineous parents and childless. He lived alone at home, was under legal protection (curatorship) and received weekly social assistance for disabled people. He stopped his education in primary school. He spent his entire professional career within ESAT (Institution and assistance service for physically/mentally disabled people), working in the maintenance of green spaces. He was not known to follow a particular diet excluding animal proteins. His medical history was an intellectual disability, issues with interpersonal relationships, behavioural disorders and type 2‐diabetes treated with metformin. He had not undergone any hospitalisation until the end of 2019.

He was admitted to the emergency room in November 2019 for a fall followed by an extended period of around 12 h lying on the ground. Neurological examination was normal. The patient was afebrile, with pronounced asthenia, biological inflammatory syndrome (hyperleukocytosis, thrombocytosis, elevated C‐reactive protein 172 mg/L, alpha‐1 protein 6.3 g/L and alpha‐2 protein 13.2 g/L on serum protein electrophoresis), elevated transaminases and slightly elevated AP and GGT (ALAT and ASAT = 3 N, GGT and AP < 2 N). On admission to the emergency room, no disturbance of consciousness was noted during the initial clinical examination, with a Glasgow score of 15. He was transferred to a general medicine department. The trauma assessment of his fall did not reveal any fracture. No infectious call points were found on chest X‐ray and urines. No glycemic imbalance was found in this diabetic patient and a reduced carbohydrate diet with a normal protein intake was put in place. The clinical condition remained stable for a week, before the sudden onset of a hypotonic coma with pyramidal signs (Glasgow Coma Scale = 4), justifying a transfer to an intensive care unit. Glycemia was normal (6.71 mmoL/L). A stroke was suspected but not confirmed by CT scan, while additional investigations (brain MRI, lumbar puncture) could not explain the coma.

Hyperammonemic encephalopathy was then suspected and confirmed by an ammonia assay performed 3 days after coma‐onset, showing a plasma concentration of 167 μmoL/L with a peak value of 1500 μmoL/L (normal plasma level < 50 μmoL/L). The patient also presented with persistent hyperlactatemia (peak value of 3.7 mmoL/L). Shortly thereafter, multiple organ failure appeared with acute renal failure (creatinine 149 μmoL/L, urea 9.25 mmoL/L) and hepatic cytolysis (ASAT 27 N/ALAT 18 N). Ammonia was controlled by hemofiltration and a fasting period relayed by a protein‐free diet (1307 μmoL/L 1 day after the start of hemofiltration, 140 μmoL/L 4 day later). The clinical outcome was unfavourable. Brain death was confirmed by cerebral CT angiography 2 weeks after coma onset.

Metabolic investigation was performed in the days following hospitalisation in the intensive care unit, as soon as hyperammonia was detected. ASL deficiency was suspected from the results of plasma amino acid profile (chromatography of plasma amino acids), showing a high level of argininosuccinic acid at 823 μmol/L (normal plasma level: unrecordable). Citrulline concentration was also elevated at 133 μmoL/L (normal plasma level < 33 μmoL/L) as well as glutamine at 1206 μmoL/L (normal plasma level < 670 μmoL/L), reflecting the significant hyperammonemia. The urinary profile of amino acid (chromatography of urinary amino acids) revealed an elevation of the same analytes: increase excretion of argininosuccinate at level of 7235 μmol/mmol of creatinine (normal urinary level: undetectable), of citrulline at level at 30 μmol/mmol of creatinine (normal urinary level: 4 μmol/mmol creatinine) and of glutamine at level of 241 μmol/mmol of creatinine (normal urinary level < 36 μmol/mmol creatinine). Urine organic acid profile showed an increase in orotic acid at 354 μmol/mmol of creatinine. Orotic acid is a cytosolic metabolite highly specific to urea cycle deficiency, synthesised from carbamoyl phosphate and accumulating into mitochondria in ASLD.","Aelish

In addition, there were craniosynostosis, microcephaly, a slightly dysmorphic face, and early development of spastic diplegia rapidly progressing to tetraparesis. Diagnosis of hyperlysinemia was established following the detection of elevated pipecolic acid. At age 4 years, motor development was severely retarded with inability to sit or stand. At this age, treatment with botulinum toxin was started and continued since then. Under this treatment, the patient learned to stand up and walk single steps with support.

104,"This 2-year-old female was born to a 20-year-old
gravida II para I-II mother following an uncomplicated pregnancy. The parents are first cousins. Birth
weight was 6 pounds and 2 ounces with a length of
20 inches. There were no perinatal complications.
She was breast-fed for one and one-half months
without any problems. However, she developed gas
and constipation on different formulas which were
relieved by soy formula. She was described as a
“picky eater.” She prefers cereal, crackers, toast,
waffles, and creamed corn and occasionally eats ice
cream but avoids meats or other sources of protein.
At 11 months of age she developed a cough and
was taken to the emergency room where she was
found to be anemic and a chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly. At this time she was noted to be ,5
percentile for growth. Echocardiogram demonstrated a left ventricular end-diastolic diameter
(LVEDD) of 26 mm (normal 16–26 mm) with shortening fraction of 23% (normal 29–42%) consistent
with dilated cardiomyopathy. Endomyocardial biopsy did not reveal myocarditis, ischemia, or signs of
storage. She did have an atrial septal defect.
Plasma carnitine levels at 12 months revealed
profound deficiency: total carnitine 6 mM, free carnitine 5 mM, and esterified carnitine 1 mM. She was
treated with L-carnitine supplement (200 mg/kg/
day). Plasma acylcarnitine analysis while being
treated with carnitine revealed markedly increased
butyryl/isobutyrylcarnitine. Skin biopsy was performed for further in vitro studies of fat oxidation.
She seemed to respond to chronic carnitine therapy
and by 27 months of age was developing and growing normally (weight .75 percentile, height .75
percentile) without any evidence of cardiac dysfunction. Repeat echocardiogram revealed, at that time,
LVEDD 23 mm and fractional shortening of 42%.","Aelish Fleming","ACAD8","yes","Isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency","611283","79159","PMID:9889013","{""HP:0001510"":""Growth delay"",""HP:0001631"":""Atrial septal defect"",""HP:0001640"":""Cardiomegaly"",""HP:0001644"":""Dilated cardiomyopathy"",""HP:0001903"":""Anemia"",""HP:0002019"":""Constipation"",""HP:0003234"":""Decreased plasma carnitine"",""HP:0010967"":""Abnormal circulating carnitine concentration"",""HP:0010972"":""Anemia of inadequate production"",""HP:0045045"":""Elevated plasma acylcarnitine levels""}","{""HP:0001903"":""Anaemia"",""HP:0010972"":""Anemia, dyserythropoietic"",""HP:0001891"":""Iron deficiency anemia"",""HP:0001640"":""Cardiomegaly"",""HP:0002119"":""Ventriculomegaly"",""HP:0002240"":""Hepatomegaly"",""HP:0010777"":""Bronchomegaly"",""HP:0001644"":""Cardiomyopathy, dilated"",""HP:0001638"":""Cardiomyopathy"",""HP:0001639"":""Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy"",""HP:0001631"":""Atrial septum defect"",""HP:0001674"":""Complete atrioventricular septal defect"",""HP:0006695"":""Atrioventricular septal defect"",""HP:0003234"":""Decreased plasma carnitine"",""HP:0030362"":""Reduced muscle carnitine level"",""HP:0010967"":""Carnitine levels abnormal"",""HP:0045061"":""Decreased carnitine level in liver"",""HP:0045045"":""Elevated plasma acylcarnitine levels"",""HP:0008315"":""Decreased plasma free carnitine"",""HP:0011936"":""Decreased plasma total carnitine"",""HP:0001510"":""Delayed growth"",""HP:0008897"":""Growth delay as children"",""HP:0002019"":""Constipation"",""HP:0012450"":""Chronic constipation"",""HP:0012451"":""Acute constipation"",""HP:0012735"":""Coughing"",""HP:0031246"":""Dry cough""}","[""ORPHA:89842"",""OMIM:607872"",""ORPHA:79404"",""ORPHA:79408"",""ORPHA:438213"",""ORPHA:2044"",""ORPHA:353281"",""ORPHA:96170"",""ORPHA:453504"",""ORPHA:352665"",""ORPHA:84"",""ORPHA:79159"",""ORPHA:99901"",""ORPHA:231214"",""OMIM:615631"",""OMIM:614921"",""OMIM:620135"",""OMIM:619991"",""OMIM:300855"",""OMIM:615895""]","[""Autosomal recessive generalized dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, intermediate form"",""Chromosome 1p36 deletion syndrome"",""Severe generalized junctional epidermolysis bullosa"",""Autosomal recessive generalized dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, severe form"",""PURA-related severe neonatal hypotonia-seizures-encephalopathy syndrome"",""Floating-Harbor syndrome"",""Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome due to 16p13.3 microdeletion"",""Emanuel syndrome"",""Neurodevelopmental disorder-craniofacial dysmorphism-cardiac defect-skeletal anomalies syndrome due to a point mutation"",""Neurodevelopmental disorder-craniofacial dysmorphism-cardiac defect-skeletal anomalies syndrome due to 9q21.3 microdeletion"",""Fanconi anemia"",""Isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency"",""Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase 9 deficiency"",""Beta-thalassemia major"",""Anemia, congenital dyserythropoietic, type Ib"",""Congenital disorder of glycosylation, type It"",""Mitochondrial complex I deficiency, nuclear type 39"",""Liver disease, severe congenital"",""Ogden syndrome"",""Polyglucosan body myopathy 1 with or without immunodeficiency""]"
105,"The patient is a woman born to healthy nonconsanguineous parents. She had normal development in the first year of life and started to walk unaided at 16 months, but the parents observed clumsy performance. At 4 years of age, she had three episodes of severe ataxia that lasted 20– 25 days, which coincided with recurrent infections. These episodes resolved slowly over the following weeks. At 5 years of age, she was referred for neurological evaluation to our hospital. Clinical examination found truncal ataxia with broad base, ataxic gait, asymmetry that was more evident on the left arm, action tremor, dysartric speech, and normal ocular movements with slight nystagmus on horizontal gaze. Normal muscle strength with brisk tendon reflexes and moderate mental retardation were seen. Cranial MRI and neurophysiological studies, including electroencephalography, electroretinography, visual and brainstem evoked potentials, electromyography, nerve conduction velocities, fundus oculi and cardiological examinations, gave normal results. At 9 years of age, the child again had crises of severe ataxia of 20 days duration. At that time, she was attending normal school with a special programme of integration for those with moderate mental retardation. After this point, she began to show improvement in some neurological signs, such as tremor and ataxia. A second cranial MRI was normal. She is currently 19 years of age. She has slight tremor and nystagmus, walks with broad base and has very clumsy performance. Cognitive evaluation rated her IQ at 54 (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children Revised: verbal 57 and manipulation 60). Routine laboratory analyses including serum amino transferases, creatinine, urea and other parameters were normal (no liver or renal dysfunction was detected). Screening for inborn errors of metabolism, including plasma and urine amino acids (no histidine accumulation), blood lactate, sialotransferrin isoelectricfocusing, creatine deficiency syndromes, purine and pyrimidine defects, and organic acidurias, gave normal results,. Hypothyroidism and coeliac disease were also excluded. Biochemical and/or genetic screening for early onset forms of inherited ataxia (Friedreich ataxia, ataxia with isolated vitamin E deficiency, ataxia teleangiectasia, abetalipoproteinaemia, and ataxia of mitochondrial origin) gave normal results.","Ines Thiele","131669","yes","Urocanic aciduria","276880","210128","PMID:19304569",,,,

Following detection of urocanic acid in her urine, she was seen for metabolic evaluation at age 5 months. Examination revealed a normal infant with weight and length both 90-95th percentiles for age and appropriate developmental milestones. Family history was negative for metabolic disorders or any other familial diseases. Her red blood cell folate level was normal at 346 μgm/L (reference 200–270).

At the age of 4 months her motor development stopped. At the age of 5months she showed severe hypotonia. This turned into a severe generalized rigidity with a mask face and absence of voluntary movements at the age of 5 years and 7 months. There was nodystonia. She had oculogyric crises of several hours duration. The child has a severe extra-pyramidal movement disorder. A cerebral MRI was normal. Routine clinical chemistry of the blood was normal.

108,"The patient was born to healthy nonconsanguineous parents after an uneventful pregnancy at term (birth weight 2,900 g, length 52 cm, head circumference 35 cm). Her mental and motor development was normal until the age of 14 months, when she suffered from a brief viral infection with high fever, diagnosed as exanthema subitum. Two weeks later, she refused to walk and became tired easily. Additionally, she developed an intention tremor, fisting of her hands, and general irritability. In the following weeks symptoms further progressed and the child was no longer able to sit or hold her head. At the age of 19 months, she was again able to hold her head and to eat with a spoon, when she suffered from a further viral infection with cervical lymphadenopathy, leading again to a worsening of the above-mentioned symptoms. At the age of 2 years and 4 months she was referred to our attention for a second opinion. She had developed severe bradykinesia, hypertonic limbs with cogwheel rigidity, and dystonic posturing of her hands. Symptoms showed a diurnal variation being much more prominent in the afternoon and evening before going to bed. She had a mask-like facial expression and only spoke two or three slurry words even though her parents were quite sure that she understood everything. Hypersalivation and a disturbed sleep pattern characterized by many brief episodes of waking up were also present. Laboratory work-up was normal with the exception of a high viral load of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), indicating an active infection. Investigations including an magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain were unremarkable. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected in the morning and immediately analyzed for the presence of cells, lactate, and amino acids, which were all in the normal range.

At birth, fetal heart rate abnormalities and meconium staining of the amniotic fluid were noted. Somatic parameters were normal (weight, 3,150gm; height, 50cm; head circumference, 34cm). The neonatal period was uneventful. After an initially normal development, muscular hypotonia and hypokinesia were first observed at 5 months of age. Symptoms progressed and fluctuated. Rigidity of the extremities and pyramidal tract signs led to a provisional diagnosis of spastic tetraparesis. Dystonic movements, tremor, and myoclonic jerks were noted. Attacks of sideward deviation of the eyes and the head occurred at intervals of approximately 3 days and lasted up to several hours. Periods of lethargy with profuse sweating alternated with periods of irritability and were both most troublesome. Numerous therapeutic interventions including L-dopa and different antiepileptics were all unsuccessful.

Somatic parameters were borderline reduced at birth (weight, 1.8kg; length, 44cm; head circumference, 30.5cm); perinatal adaptation was uneventful. Psychomotor development was judged to be unremarkable until 4 months of age. Thereafter, motor development did not progress and paroxysmal dystonia of the neck, oculogyric crises (Fig 2), drooling, cloni, and rigidity developed. During these attacks, which lasted up to several hours, the child appeared alert and responsive. They ceased after sleep and could be stopped by diazepam. Over the years the girl followed a clinical course very similar to her brother with pronounced hypokinesia, mask face, increasing rigidity, tremor, and development of pyramidal tract signs.

The onset of scoliosis was first noted at four years of age, and treatment with an underarm spinal brace was initiated at another center. The deformity remained stable until the age of 10 years, after which it rapidly progressed during her pubertal growth spurt. During this period, compliance with brace treatment was poor, and its effectiveness was further limited by the patient's significant overweight status. At presentation, the patient, who was premenarchal, had a body weight of 63 kg, placing her above the 95th percentile for her age and sex. Her calculated BMI was 31.2, indicating obesity, and her arm span was measured at 142 cm, falling between the 25th and 50th percentiles for stature.

Clinically, the patient exhibited hyperactivity. Despite a balanced spine with level shoulders and pelvis, there was a mild thoracic translocation to the right and no leg length discrepancy. However, a severe thoracic and lumbar deformity was evident, accompanied by a significant rib hump adjacent to the convexity of the thoracic scoliosis and a marked waistline asymmetry with pelvic prominence on the concavity of the lumbar curve. No skin or soft tissue abnormalities were noted over the spine. The patient was ambulatory within the community and exhibited no neurological deficits. Neurological examination revealed normal muscle tone, power, sensation, and tendon reflexes in both upper and lower limbs, with symmetrical abdominal reflexes and no upper motor neuron signs.

Radiographic assessment revealed a rigid right thoracic scoliosis (75°) from T4 to T10 and a left lumbar scoliosis (65°) from T11 to L4. Supine maximum side-bending and traction radiographs confirmed the rigidity of both curves. Radiological evaluation excluded congenital abnormalities of the vertebral column and chest wall, congenital spinal stenosis, and abnormalities in interpedicular distance. The Risser grade was 0, indicating significant remaining growth potential and a risk for further progression of scoliosis.","FKM","RAI1","yes","Smith-Magenis syndrome","182290","819.0","Surgical treatment of scoliosis in Smith-Magenis syndrome: a case report | Journal of Medical Case Reports | Full Text

Her developmental milestones were significantly delayed; she began sitting at 12 months, walking at 24 months, and forming sentences by age 4. At 5 years old, she was hospitalized for growth retardation and hematuria. Biochemical tests were unremarkable, but urinalysis revealed hematuria and proteinuria, and voiding cystourethrography confirmed vesicoureteral reflux. She was referred to the medical genetics clinic for growth retardation and renal function impairment. Anthropometric measurements showed a height of 107 cm (−4.3 SD), head circumference of 47 cm (−3.6 SD), and weight of 18 kg (−2.9 SD). Physical examination identified microcephaly, a prominent forehead, hypertelorism, nasal root flattening, upslanting palpebral fissures, anteverted nares, a long philtrum, a wide mouth with a narrow high palate, and posteriorly rotated low-set ears. Limb anomalies included brachydactyly of the fifth fingers, bilateral partial cutaneous syndactyly of the second and third toes, and clinodactyly of the fourth and fifth toes. Imaging studies revealed advanced developmental dysplasia of the hip with a shallow left acetabulum and significant femoral head degeneration, brachydactyly and brachymesophalangia in the fifth fingers, and clinodactyly in the toes. Additional findings included amblyopia and myopia on eye examination, severe developmental delay compared to peers, and focal caliectasis in the left kidney (11 × 7 mm) detected via renal Doppler ultrasonography.

119,"A 13-year-old boy presented to our hospital with a 10-day history of swelling in the lower anterior region of the jaw. The swelling measured approximately 2 cm × 1 cm, was soft to firm in consistency, and tender on palpation. Intraoral examination revealed the persistence of deciduous teeth with the absence of several permanent teeth. Orthopantomogram imaging identified three cystic lesions in the mandible and two in the maxillary sinus, associated with displaced permanent teeth. Further radiological evaluation, including a skull radiograph, showed bilamellar calcification of the falx cerebri, consistent with a diagnosis of Gorlin-Goltz Syndrome (GGS). Physical examination findings included macrocephaly (head circumference of 92 cm, exceeding the normal range), frontal bossing, a depressed nasal bridge, hypertelorism, mandibular prognathism, and brown-colored palmar pits measuring 1–3 mm. There were no other systemic anomalies. Surgical intervention involved intraoral cyst enucleation under general anesthesia, following the placement of an arch bar to stabilize the mandible and splint the teeth. Histopathological analysis of the enucleated tissue confirmed the presence of odontogenic keratocyst (OKC), characterized by a parakeratinized squamous epithelial lining with palisaded basal cells and satellite cysts in the connective tissue wall. Carnoy’s solution was applied post-enucleation, and the cavity was packed with bismuth iodine paraffin paste.

120,"A 13-year-old boy presented with swelling in the right cheek region that had gradually increased over two months. Examination revealed a diffuse, non-tender, soft to rubbery swelling on the right side of the face. Intraoral evaluation identified a sinus in the right retromolar area with creamy white discharge. Panoramic radiography revealed three distinct radiolucencies with sclerotic borders: the largest lesion (4 × 3 cm) was located in the right mandibular angle, extending into the ramus and associated with an impacted third molar displaced to the inferior mandibular border; the second lesion (3 × 2 cm) was in the left mandibular angle with another impacted third molar; the third lesion (1 × 1 cm) was situated between teeth 13 and 14. General examination showed relative macrocephaly, mild hypertelorism, and palmar and plantar pitting. Radiographs confirmed macrocephaly, spina bifida of cervical vertebrae, mild scoliosis, and shortened fourth and fifth metacarpals. Laboratory tests were normal, and there was no relevant family history. Marsupialization was performed initially to reduce the size of the mandibular lesions, followed by enucleation of all cysts and removal of impacted teeth, with bony defects treated using Carnoy’s solution. Histological analysis confirmed keratocystic odontogenic tumors, showing a stratified squamous parakeratinized epithelium with palisaded basal cells, daughter cysts, and epithelial islands. Complete resolution of the cysts was achieved clinically and radiologically within one year, with follow-up imaging at 18 months showing complete bone healing without recurrence.","FKM","PTCH1","yes","Basal cell nevus syndrome","109400","377.0","Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome: A Case Report and Review - PMC

122,"A 13-year-old female of Caucasian ethnic origin originated from a small town in the north-west area of Sicily. The father had epilepsy in childhood (responsive to carbamazepine, discontinued after a few years), and the mother had migraine; two siblings were healthy. Psychomotor developmental milestones were reached at the correct age; past medical history was uneventful but for sporadic migraine episodes since childhood and sleep apnea with snoring. At the age of 10 years, during wakefulness, she presented an episode of loss of awareness, head and eye deviation to the right, and gestural automatisms lasting a few minutes, followed by gradual, spontaneous recovery. The second episode occurred 4 months later, during sleep, when she was found unconscious with bilateral clonic jerking. EEG recording, performed soon after the seizure, reported multifocal spikes and sharp waves. She was treated with levetiracetam at a dose of 750 mg/daily. After 2 years without seizures, levetiracetam was gradually stopped. Yet, 3 months after discontinuing the medication, seizures relapsed, and treatment was restarted. On clinical examination, she showed hands and feet smaller than expected, mild bilateral ptosis, mild bradykinesia, and clumsiness in gross motor tasks. Deep tendon reflexes were normal. No psychiatric comorbidities emerged from clinical observation and anamnestic interview with the girl However, her parents described her as shy and avoidant of social interaction with peers.

125,"A 13-year-old girl presented with a history of recurring dizziness and headaches lasting over three months, with worsening symptoms in the preceding two weeks. She had a medical history of arterial catheterization performed for a congenital cardiac anomaly at one year of age but no history of seizures.

Upon admission, her physical examination revealed elevated blood pressure in both upper limbs, measuring 160/83 mmHg on the right and 154/93 mmHg on the left. A distinctive facial appearance was observed, characterized by specific features that contributed to her overall phenotype. She demonstrated a friendly demeanor, engaging in conversation with a high level of enthusiasm and mimicking the tone and expressions of adults. However, her learning ability was below average for her age, and she exhibited poor calculation skills. Cardiac auscultation revealed a grade 3/6 systolic whistle-like murmur in the aortic valve area, with no additional pathological murmurs detected elsewhere.

Radiological investigations included digital X-ray imaging, which showed dense shadows in the projection area of the aortic node, while the lungs appeared clear and the heart shadow was small. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the aorta revealed localized narrowing in the aortic arch with a diameter of 5 mm at its narrowest point. The narrowing was determined to be noneccentric, ruling out closure of the congenital cardiac anomaly as the cause. No calcifications, dilations, or dissection were observed in the aortic vascular wall.

Genetic analysis was performed through whole-exome sequencing, targeting relevant gene coding regions using a second-generation sequencing platform. Copy number variation sequencing (CNV-seq) identified a novel 1.46 Mb deletion in the 7q11.23 region (seq[hg19] chr7: 72718227–74131386). This deletion included genes implicated in haploinsufficiency, aligning with the patient’s clinical findings.

Following a multidisciplinary consultation, the diagnosis was confirmed, and surgical intervention was recommended. Due to the patient’s age and surgical risks, stent implantation between the ages of 20 and 30 years was proposed to delay surgery.

126,"A 13-year-old girl was admitted for the surgical correction of scoliosis, with initial radiographic evaluation revealing a thoracic scoliosis characterized by a Cobb angle of 74°. Her past medical history included a total correction of Tetralogy of Fallot at the age of eight. Clinical examination identified significant developmental challenges, including mental retardation. The patient exhibited sleep disturbances, such as snoring, shortness of breath, and gasping during sleep, prompting a referral to the Otorhinolaryngology Department. Investigations revealed obstructive sleep apnea, tonsillar hypertrophy, conductive hearing loss, and agenesis of the epiglottis. Genetic testing using interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization at chromosome 17p11.2 identified a heterozygous deletion, providing a molecular basis for her condition.

Further evaluation of her scoliosis identified a left upper thoracic curve (T1-T7) measuring 74° and a right main thoracic curve (T7-L1) measuring 60°. A Risser grade of I suggested a high potential for further progression. Computed tomography highlighted vertebral anomalies, including dysplasia of the T5 and T6 vertebral bodies and spinal stenosis from T1 to T5. Despite the absence of significant findings in the renal and abdominal ultrasounds, cardiological examination revealed mild pulmonary stenosis, right ventricular enlargement, and mild aortic valve thickening. Restrictive ventilatory dysfunction was also identified during respiratory assessment. Magnetic resonance imaging was initially contraindicated due to the presence of steel wires from her earlier cardiac surgery, which were subsequently removed, allowing for MRI imaging. This revealed the presence of syringomyelia.

Surgical intervention involved a posterior correction and fusion from T1 to L1 using the Moss-SI spinal system. The procedure, lasting five hours with a blood loss of 600 mL, successfully corrected the upper thoracic Cobb angle from 74° to 20° (73% correction) and the main thoracic Cobb angle from 60° to 28° (37% correction). Postoperatively, the patient exhibited no signs of respiratory dysfunction and maintained normal spinal cord signals during intraoperative monitoring. Wound complications emerged eight months after surgery but resolved completely with resuturing.

127,"A 13-year-old right-handed boy presented with a history of seizures beginning at age 3. His seizures were characterized by initial feelings of sickness, followed by cloudy consciousness, hand motor automatisms, and secondary generalized tonic–clonic seizures. Despite being managed with various antiepileptic drugs, his seizures became intractable by age 18. Imaging at age 13 revealed a small calcification in the subcortical white matter of the left frontal lobe, which was later confirmed by a CT scan at age 24. MRI at this age showed focal cortical thickening, blurring of the gray–white matter junction, and subcortical hyperintensity in the left frontal lobe, with the calcified lesion estimated to be in the lower part of the hyperintensity area. Further evaluations, including EEG, PET, and SPECT scans, revealed hypometabolism, hypoperfusion, and paroxysmal discharges in the left frontal region. Surgical intervention involved resecting the epileptogenic cortex and surrounding tissues, including the subcortical lesion. Histological analysis revealed disrupted cortical lamination with dysmorphic neurons and balloon cells in the cortex and subcortical white matter. The calcified lesion was found to be associated with the FCD lesion but not independent of it.

132,"A 15-year-old female presented for dental treatment, reporting concerns about “ugly teeth and malocclusion.” Her medical history revealed multiple congenital anomalies, including the presence of a single kidney, tracheal stenosis, syndactyly, and an omphalocele. She had undergone various surgeries in her early years, such as tracheal dilatation, correction of the omphalocele, and repair of syndactyly. At 14 years, she also had a hysterectomy. Despite these health challenges, she had normal cognitive function and no visual impairments, although she did experience partial hearing loss in the left ear and had a low voice tone. Her regular medications included alendronate, calcium carbonate, lubricating eye drops, and hormone replacement therapy.

Upon physical examination, the patient exhibited several distinctive features, such as mild facial asymmetry, hypertelorism (widely spaced eyes), a broad and beaked nose, and a short philtrum. She also had low-set ears, sparse eyebrows, and cryptophthalmic eyes with membrane-covered corneas. Intraoral examination revealed significant dental anomalies, including an atresic maxilla, anterior open bite, posterior crossbite, and bilateral congenitally missing maxillary and mandibular lateral incisors. Additionally, the patient had short roots in all her teeth. Radiographic investigation confirmed the diagnosis of hypodontia, with no history of tooth extraction due to trauma, caries, or periodontal disease.

Dental treatment was planned to address the malocclusion and dental anomalies. Initially, rapid maxillary expansion and orthodontic leveling of the lower arch were performed. However, as the maxillary central incisors developed mobility due to the absence of roots, further orthodontic treatment was contraindicated, and tooth extraction was necessary. The patient's alendronate medication was temporarily suspended for 3 months before and after the extractions to reduce the risk of complications. Following tooth extraction, dental implants were placed in the two maxillary central incisor sites, with efforts made to improve the initial implant stability due to low-density alveolar bone. Over several months, the patient underwent further stages of treatment, including the installation of healing abutments, impression taking, and the creation of individual ceramic crowns and porcelain veneers for aesthetic restoration.

The final outcome of the treatment was successful both functionally and aesthetically, with the patient expressing strong satisfaction with the results. A follow-up assessment 6 months after the procedure showed excellent results.","FKM","FRAS1","yes","FRASER SYNDROME","219000","2052.0","

Both hair growth and texture, as well as skin appearance, were normal. However, examination of the nails revealed long, thin nail beds on all digits of both hands, consistent with koilonychia.

Extraoral examination identified no facial asymmetry, and the movements of the temporomandibular joint were well-coordinated and synchronized. Notable findings included strabismus, a hypoplastic maxilla resulting in a concave facial profile, and incompetent lips.

Intraoral examination revealed the absence of multiple teeth, including maxillary central incisors and premolars, as well as mandibular canines and premolars. The right lateral incisor in the maxillary arch appeared peg-shaped. The patient exhibited a bilateral Angle’s Class III molar relationship.

Radiographic evaluation through an orthopantomogram confirmed the clinical findings, showing multiple missing permanent teeth, including 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 21, 22, 24, and 25 in the maxillary arch, and 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 41, 42, 43, 44, and 45 in the mandibular arch.

Based on clinical and radiographic evidence, the diagnosis was consistent with a rare genetic condition characterized by familial hypodontia, nail abnormalities such as onychorrhexis and koilonychia, and associated features.","FKM","MSX1","yes","Witkop syndrome","189500","2228.0"," https://www.researchgate.net/publication/373874501_Tooth_and_Nail_Syndrome-_A_Rare_Case_Report_and_Review_of_Literature",,,,
134,"A 15-year-old girl with a history of frequent seizures and syncope was admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit for further evaluation. She presented with episodes of absent-mindedness, during which her head would turn to the left, she would talk irrelevantly, and end with sudden syncope, often accompanied by falls. Despite normal cardiac tests, her condition persisted, and brain MRI revealed abnormalities in the bilateral insular, temporal, and parietal lobes. Video EEG (VEEG) monitoring revealed focal rhythmic epileptiform discharges (FREDs) with a frequency of 16-20 Hz, localized primarily in the right temporo-occipital regions. During these seizures, the patient experienced prolonged asystole (23 seconds) after a period of bradycardia, leading to complete body atonia and syncope. The VEEG findings confirmed the correlation between the seizures and cardiac events, underscoring the role of the insular cortex and other brain regions in generating these autonomic responses. This case emphasizes the importance of VEEG in diagnosing and localizing epileptic zones and highlights the potential benefits of cardiac interventions, such as pacemaker implantation or cardioneuroablation, to reduce morbidity in patients with refractory epilepsy associated with ictal asystole and syncope.","FKM","CNTNAP2","yes","CORTICAL DYSPLASIA-FOCAL EPILEPSY SYNDROME","610042","163681.0","

135,"A 15-year-old male presented with progressive swelling on the right side of both the upper and lower jaws, which had gradually increased over ten months. Clinical examination revealed firm and slightly tender swellings. Radiological evaluation through an orthopantomograph showed multiple radiolucent lesions in both maxillae and the right mandible, with ectopic teeth displaced by enlarging cysts. Computed tomography scans confirmed these findings, while additional features included hypertelorism and synophrys, though no calcification of the falx cerebri was observed. A chest radiograph revealed a bifid rib on the right side, and skin lesions such as basal cell nevi or keratosis were absent. Surgical intervention involved enucleation of cysts under general anesthesia, with intraoral access in all quadrants. Impacted teeth (17, 18, 28, 38, and 48) were extracted, and remnants of the cysts were chemically cauterized using Carnoy’s solution. Histopathological analysis identified the cystic linings as parakeratinized stratified squamous epithelium with palisading nuclei and tombstone appearance, confirming the diagnosis of odontogenic keratocysts. The presence of major signs, such as multiple odontogenic keratocysts and bifid rib, along with the minor sign of hypertelorism, confirmed the suspected condition.

136,"A 16-year-old male patient was brought to the genetics clinic due to concerns about developmental delays, tremors, and behavioral issues. He had a normal full-term delivery but exhibited delayed milestones, beginning to walk at 18 months and speaking his first words at two years old. His parents reported a history of nervousness, immature behaviors, lack of eye contact, and aggression. Tremors in his hands started around the age of three and progressively worsened, leading to difficulties with fine motor skills, such as drinking from a cup, and increased behavioral problems, including biting, kicking, spitting, and frequent conflicts with peers. His teachers observed these behavioral challenges, and he was subsequently managed with risperidone, valproic acid, and Adderall, which improved some behaviors. On physical examination, he displayed distinct facial features, including a high nasal bridge, slightly down-slanting palpebral fissures, a long philtrum, and a thin upper lip. Neurological findings included bilateral hand tremors, slightly increased deep tendon reflexes, and a positive Babinski sign on the right side. He had a slow gait with reduced arm swing and a stooped posture. Psychological assessments revealed functioning below his chronological age, with mild autism features noted on the Childhood Autism Rating Scale. A family history revealed similar symptoms, including tremors and developmental delays, in the patient’s brother and maternal relatives.

137,"A 16-year-old male with no significant past medical history presented with complaints of intermittent headaches, visual blurring, and vomiting for two months, accompanied by periorbital puffiness over the last 20 days. The headaches were holocranial, nonthrobbing, and associated with transient bilateral visual blurring without ocular pain or redness. Vomiting episodes occurred intermittently, and there was no history of seizures, focal neurological deficits, or loss of consciousness. Facial puffiness, more pronounced in the mornings, developed after 1.5 months of symptom onset. There were no associated symptoms such as fever, sore throat, pedal edema, dysuria, hematuria, anorexia, or decreased urine output. Initial evaluation at a local clinic revealed high blood pressure (170/100 mmHg), elevated serum creatinine (2.1 mg/dL), and proteinuria (2+). Urine microscopy showed red blood cells (RBCs), pus cells, and granular casts. Despite treatment with amlodipine, the patient was referred for further management. On admission, his blood pressure was 180/106 mmHg, and physical examination revealed mild pallor without edema or other systemic abnormalities. Laboratory investigations showed anemia, mild hyperkalemia, and proteinuria with persistent microscopic hematuria. Fundoscopic examination revealed an ""oil drop"" appearance suggestive of anterior lenticonus, and audiometry confirmed bilateral mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss. A kidney biopsy showed focal fibrocellular crescents, patchy tubular injury, interstitial fibrosis, and characteristic abnormalities in the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) on electron microscopy, including splitting, thinning, thickening, and a basket-weave pattern. Family screening for similar symptoms was unremarkable, and genetic testing was declined.

140,"A 19-year-old male from Norway, with healthy, non-consanguineous parents, sought care at a reference center for rare connective tissue disorders. He had previously been diagnosed with Larsen syndrome, based on clinical findings from the neonatal period. He was born with dislocated, hyperextended knees (up to 90 degrees), which were initially treated with serial casting, though this was unsuccessful. Subsequently, he underwent surgery involving an Ilizarov’s frame and braces at 9 months of age. His feet showed adductovarus, which responded well to non-surgical treatment. He had a kyphotic neck, with subluxation of C3-C4 and dislocations of C4-C5 and C5-C6. A C1 to C5 fixation using a rib bone graft was performed at 16 months. A small mandible and occult cleft palate were also noted, alongside some ventricular dilatation observed in cerebral ultrasound. Hypotonia, joint hypermobility in the knees, ankles, and wrists, an umbilical hernia, and a large left medial inguinal hernia were also present.

As a toddler, he had recurrent episodes of serous otitis media, leading to a consultation with an ENT specialist. This resulted in the identification of combined conductive and sensorineural hearing loss, for which he required a hearing aid. He was also followed by an ophthalmologist for hyperopia, astigmatism, and exotropia. His hyperopia was corrected with glasses, while exotropia was treated with patching and strabismus surgery.

142,"A 2.5-year-old boy presented with a history of early exfoliation of the mandibular primary canines and the maxillary right primary canine. Clinical examination revealed the absence of all maxillary and mandibular primary incisors, which his parents confirmed had never erupted. External features included eversion of the lips and fine hair, with normal eyebrows and eyelashes. Notably, the patient exhibited no symptoms of heat intolerance or inability to sweat. Examination of the toenails indicated they were spoon-shaped and hypoplastic.

Radiographic assessment demonstrated the presence of primary anterior teeth germs. However, due to the child’s lack of cooperation, panoramic imaging was not possible. Laboratory diagnostic tests to evaluate serum alkaline phosphatase and urinary phosphoethanolamine levels revealed no abnormalities. Family history revealed no similar anomalies among relatives, except for a cleft palate in a maternal cousin. The parents displayed normal dentition and nail development, with no abnormalities observed in their nails, scalp, or hair.

During the six-month follow-up, the primary mandibular central teeth erupted, but the maxillary primary incisors did not, and the left central tooth was subsequently lost. Radiography performed to assess the permanent teeth development showed no evidence of permanent incisor tooth germs. The patient’s parents declined prosthetic intervention despite recommendations, citing satisfactory posterior teeth function for chewing and mastication.

143,"A 20-year-old Caucasian woman was admitted after experiencing a syncopal episode caused by ventricular tachycardia. She had no family history of long QT interval or any significant cardiovascular events. Prior to this episode, she led an active lifestyle with no history of hypoglycemia, liver issues, or muscle weakness, and displayed no signs of cardiomyopathy. An echocardiogram showed normal results. Upon hospitalization, she began therapy with metoprolol (50 mg/day), and a defibrillator was implanted for further precaution. Despite pharmacologic treatment, she experienced three more syncopal episodes over the following 5 years. An ECG revealed a prolonged QT interval (QT 355 ms; QTc 441 ms, normal range <440 ms).

At age 25, while pregnant, the patient had multiple syncopal episodes. At 14 weeks of gestation, her metoprolol dose was increased to 75 mg/day, and mexiletine (450 mg/day) was added. These adjustments led to no further episodes during her pregnancy.

The patient's diagnosis came after her newborn daughter tested positive for low free carnitine, prompting further investigation into the patient’s condition. Her plasma carnitine levels were severely reduced (total carnitine: 3.0 μM, normal range 26–69 μM; free: 1.9 μM, normal range 16–60 μM). Carnitine uptake in fibroblasts was reduced to 4.8% of normal controls. Molecular genetic analysis of the SLC22A5 gene revealed two mutations, c.95 A>G (p.N32S) and c.136 C>G (p.P46S). While alternative genetic causes of long QT syndrome were considered, they were excluded. 

Carnitine treatment (3,960 mg/day) was immediately initiated, and since then, her plasma carnitine levels have normalized (total carnitine 47.95 μM, free carnitine 36.05 μM), and she has not experienced any further syncopal episodes. The QT interval also returned to normal (QT 360 ms, QTc 408 ms). With the normalization of her carnitine levels, the dose of metoprolol was reduced to 25 mg/day, and other medications were discontinued. Nevertheless, she continues to carry a defibrillator for precaution. A follow-up cardiologic evaluation showed that her echocardiogram remained normal.

Histopathological evaluation revealed stratified squamous parakeratinizing epithelium overlying a fibro-cellular stroma with loosely arranged collagen fibers, smooth muscle bundles, nerve fascicles, thick-walled blood vessels, and ectopic cartilaginous tissue. Additional staining techniques highlighted the connective tissue components. Clinical examination showed a normal-statured, well-oriented individual with micrognathia, pseudo-clefting of the lower lip, midline philtrum pits, low-set ears, dry skin, scanty hair, and facial milia. Intra-orally, there was a mesio-labial rotation of the right central incisor, midline diastema, median alveolar cleft, high labial frenal attachment, and a small soft tissue swelling near the left central incisor. Medical history was unremarkable, but the patient was noted to have been born prematurely with low birth weight and reported learning difficulties.

Over the last two years, he also developed multiple localized erythematous papules on his forehead. In addition to these dermatological concerns, he sought medical attention for repeated episodes of melena and hematochezia that had persisted for approximately one month. The patient denied any history of systemic diseases, trauma, or similar dermatological conditions in other family members. However, his sister had a history of thyroid cancer.  

Clinical examination revealed multiple punctate hyperkeratotic macules on both palms and soles, as well as skin-colored papules on the nose. The oral mucosa and tongue displayed cobblestone-like erythematous papules. Endoscopic evaluation demonstrated widespread hamartomatous papillomatosis affecting the stomach, duodenum, and esophagus, while colonoscopy revealed multiple small polyps. Histopathological analysis of biopsied gastric and colorectal polyps identified hyperplastic and inflammatory changes with reactive lymphoid follicles. A biopsy of the palm confirmed marked hyperkeratosis with epidermal proliferation, while a biopsy of the forehead papules showed follicular keratin plugging consistent with folliculitis.

Family history revealed an elder brother who had succumbed to chronic renal disease at the age of 23. Systemic examination revealed severe anemia (Hb 4.3 mg/dL) and hypertension. Laboratory investigations demonstrated elevated blood urea (232 mg/dL) and serum creatinine (13.1 mg/dL), alongside borderline hyponatremia (131 mg/dL) and hypokalemia (6.6 mg/L). Urine analysis indicated significant proteinuria (albumin 4+) and microscopic hematuria. Renal ultrasound showed normal-sized kidneys with increased echogenicity, indicative of medical renal disease. Audiometry confirmed bilateral moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss.

Ocular examination revealed uncorrected visual acuity of 5/60 in both eyes, which improved to 6/36 with a prescription of –1.75 DS. Slit-lamp examination identified anterior lenticonus in both eyes, characterized by an old droplet appearance on retro-illumination. The rest of the anterior segment appeared normal. Fundus examination showed no specific retinal abnormalities.

The constellation of findings, including the clinical triad of hemorrhagic nephritis, progressive sensorineural hearing loss, and anterior lenticonus, combined with the family history, strongly suggested a specific oculorenal syndrome.

The patient had a history of similar episodes starting at the age of 14, which were self-resolving within 1-2 minutes. The syncopal episode just prior to admission led to a visit to a local hospital, where electrocardiography (ECG) revealed sinus rhythm, prolonged QT interval, frequent ventricular premature beats (FVPB), R-on-T, and Torsade de Pointes (TdP). Despite treatment with esmolol, magnesium sulfate, and potassium chloride, her condition did not improve, prompting immediate transfer to our facility for further management.

Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were recorded as blood pressure 98/65 mmHg, pulse rate 74 bpm, body temperature 36.5°C, and breathing rate 22 bpm. Physical examination showed no signs of heart failure or neurological abnormalities. An ECG revealed a sinus rhythm with a prolonged QT interval (QTc: 540 ms). Echocardiography showed no structural abnormalities, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 61%. Laboratory tests revealed a slightly elevated troponin level, while N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide, liver and kidney function, and electrolyte levels were within normal limits. Brain and chest CT scans were unremarkable. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with type 2cLQTS, FVPB, R-on-T, TdP, and Adams-Stokes syndrome.

During hospitalization, the patient was closely monitored with an ECG telemetry system. At 6 pm on the day of admission, she experienced palpitations, dizziness, and transient loss of consciousness, which resolved within a few seconds. The ECG telemetry revealed that TdP had spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm. The following day, the patient reported chest tightness and palpitations during sleep, with subsequent ECG showing a shorter duration of ventricular tachycardia (VT) that also self-converted to sinus rhythm. No further episodes of VT or syncope occurred, and her condition remained stable thereafter.

For treatment, the patient was started on a combination of propranolol, mexilol, and potassium magnesium aspartate tablets, along with intravenous infusions of lidocaine, magnesium sulfate, and potassium chloride. A subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator (S-ICD) was also implanted for atrial pacing and to prevent sudden death. 

A detailed family history revealed that the patient's mother had experienced a similar episode, while her father had no such history. Genetic testing revealed a novel mutation in the KCNH2 gene (c.2108dupA). Genetic sequencing of the family confirmed the presence of the same mutation in her mother and sister.

152,"A 24-month-old Japanese boy was referred to the hospital for evaluation of short stature. He was born at 38 weeks and 4 days of gestation with a submucous cleft palate and micrognathia. His birth weight was 3225 g (+0.53 SD), and his length was 45 cm (−1.80 SD). The submucous cleft palate was repaired at 18 months, coinciding with tympanostomy tube placement for secretory otitis media. Auditory brainstem response testing yielded normal results. At 22 months, bilateral leukocoria led to phacoemulsification and anterior vitrectomy for lens opacities at another hospital. Speech delay was managed with speech therapy, but the association of ophthalmic and craniofacial features was not explored.

At presentation, the patient weighed 11.6 kg (−0.33 SD) with a height of 79.1 cm (−2.52 SD). Physical examination revealed ocular hypertelorism, prominent eyes due to shallow orbits, a flat midface with a depressed nasal bridge, anteverted nares, micrognathia, and low-set ears. He exhibited limited bilateral elbow flexion but no signs of hypotonia, joint hyperextensibility, or joint pain. Anthropometric measurements showed an arm span of 79 cm, a sitting height of 48.5 cm, and a sitting height/height ratio of 0.61. Radiographs revealed calvarial thickening, metaphyseal flaring of the distal humerus, lack of femoral head ossification, femoral neck deformity, and abnormal epiphyseal ossification of the femur and tibia. Laboratory findings included normal growth hormone response to stimulation tests and normal thyroid function. Imaging studies ruled out intracranial or cardiac abnormalities. Although initial suspicion pointed to a connective tissue disorder, genetic testing for COL11A1 mutations was negative.

By the age of 8 years, the patient’s short stature had shown gradual improvement, with a height of 116.2 cm (−1.89 SD). Facial features had become less pronounced. Radiological imaging identified atlantoaxial dysplasia, but the patient remained asymptomatic regarding atlantoaxial instability. He exhibited no signs of retinal detachment, hearing loss, or early-onset osteoarthritis. The patient attended a regular elementary school and demonstrated normal cognitive development. Genetic analysis of the COL2A1 gene identified a novel heterozygous mutation, c.1142G>A (p.Gly381Asp), located in the conserved Gly-X-Y motif of the type II collagen triple helix. Computational predictions indicated the mutation was likely deleterious, supported by its absence in multiple genetic variant databases.

153,"A 25-year-old female presented with a missed abortion at 17 weeks of gestation, marking her first conception. She had no prior history of fetal demise, congenital anomalies, or consanguinity. The patient opted for a planned termination of pregnancy, and the products of conception were sent for autopsy, histopathological examination, and genetic testing after obtaining informed consent. Ultrasonography revealed no fetal heart activity, suggesting fetal death in utero, along with findings of an occipital encephalocele measuring 12 × 3 cm and enlarged, hyper-echoic, multicystic kidneys. The right kidney measured 5.5 × 2.5 cm and the left kidney 5.3 × 2.3 cm, with no other gross abnormalities noted in the abdominal, thoracic, or pelvic organs. Additionally, polydactyly was observed in both lower limb extremities and the right upper limb, and male genitalia were present. The kidneys displayed cystic changes, consistent with the ultrasonographic findings. Histopathological examination confirmed fetal glomeruli and cystic dilation of the renal tubules, as well as fetal hematopoiesis in the liver.

He had been experiencing syncopal episodes and sudden, self-resolving seizures over the past 4-5 months. Family history was notable for sudden deaths at a young age. Upon admission, the patient was initially combative but stable, and his 12-lead electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed a prolonged corrected QT interval (QTc) of 710 msec and U waves, which correlated with low potassium levels of 3.1. A urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine. Within hours, his mental status improved, and he provided a coherent history, but shortly thereafter, he had a seizure-like event. An EKG monitor revealed wide complex, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, which reverted to sinus rhythm in seconds. The patient had two additional episodes of ventricular tachycardia, each lasting 5-7 seconds before resolving spontaneously.

Following initial stabilization, the patient was intubated and transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit (CCU). Serial EKGs revealed a prolonged QTc, which gradually normalized over two days. Given the family history of sudden death and the patient's seizures, a diagnosis of congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) was considered, and an epinephrine-induced QT stress test was planned. Before the test, the patient's QTc was 440 msec, and during the stress test, the QTc prolonged to 570 msec after 10 minutes of epinephrine infusion. The epinephrine rate was increased, and after an additional 5 minutes, the QTc further prolonged to 600 msec. The test was deemed positive, and the infusion was stopped. The QTc quickly reverted to baseline after cessation of epinephrine.

Samples of the membrane were collected for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis, both in the fixed and dry states.  

The clinical examination of the patient’s family revealed additional findings. The mother exhibited atrophic hypopigmented lesions on her abdomen and a linear hyperpigmented lesion on her right arm. Ophthalmological evaluation of the mother identified a focal cataract. Family history provided by the maternal grandmother revealed the death of a male infant 30 years prior, who displayed similar skin abnormalities described as ""burned skin"" and syndactyly shortly before succumbing in the first days of life.  

Further investigations in the current patient revealed significant anomalies. Radiological imaging showed no pathological calcifications in the bone epiphyses but identified calcifications in the soft tissue. Computed tomography (CT) scans of the skull demonstrated agenesis of the corpus callosum, cerebellar hypoplasia, agenesis of the cerebellar vermis, and the presence of a Dandy-Walker cyst. Microphthalmia was also observed.

172,"a 30-year-old female who has experienced a complex array of symptoms since early childhood. From the age of 4, she began to present with moderate to severe vulgar ichthyosis, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and absence-like episodes. These were associated with a severe delay in psychomotor development and an absence of language acquisition. By the age of 10, she developed recurrent bronco-pulmonary infections and dysphagia, leading to the diagnosis of a megaesophagus with achalasia, which required several surgical interventions. At 27 and 29 years old, she underwent surgeries for breast fibroadenomas. Throughout her life, she continued to suffer from generalized tonic-clonic seizures, with their frequency varying between two per year and monthly clusters that lasted 3-4 days. Despite being on phenobarbital (150 mg/day), phenytoin (300 mg/day), and nitrazepam (15 mg/day), seizure control remained inadequate.

Upon admission to the hospital, the patient underwent extensive evaluations, including neurological, dermatological, endocrinological, and ophthalmological assessments, along with neurophysiological investigations (wakefulness and sleep EEG, EMG) and neuroimaging with a 3 Tesla brain MRI. The neurological examination revealed craniofacial dysmorphisms such as biparietal microcephaly, tight horizontal palpebral fissures with blepharophimosis, a prominent nasal root and bridge, bulbous nasal tip with hypoplastic nasal wings, hypertelorism, a thin upper lip, and fleshy, everted lower lip. EEG studies revealed abnormal brain activity, including low-amplitude posterior background activity, fast rhythmic activities in the anterior leads, and sporadic diffuse fast spike-polyspike-wave abnormalities, occasionally more prominent in the left hemisphere. EMG studies indicated sensitive-motor, primarily axonal polyneuropathy. Dermatological evaluation confirmed moderate ichthyosis, while the endocrinological assessment showed oligo-amenorrhoea with abnormal gonadotropic hormone levels, indicative of mild hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism. The brain MRI showed thickening of the left temporo-polar cortical mantle around an unusually deep sulcus and blurring of the boundary between the white and gray matter, suggesting an abnormality in the left temporal region","FKM","CNTNAP2","yes","CORTICAL DYSPLASIA-FOCAL EPILEPSY SYNDROME","610042","163681.0","

174,"A 32-year-old female patient was initially diagnosed at the age of 5 during an examination prompted by symptoms associated with thyroid dysfunction. Genetic evaluation confirmed a chromosomal anomaly characterized by 46 XX (7q11.23) using FISH analysis. Her medical history highlighted ongoing management for thyroid hormone insufficiency with L-thyroxin (50 mcg daily), maintaining thyroid hormone levels within the normal range.

She was admitted to the endocrinology clinic with complaints of mild hypercalcemia, presenting with total calcium at 11.7 mg/dL (normal range 8.6-10.0 mg/dL) and ionized calcium at 5.94 mg/dL (normal range 4.64-5.68 mg/dL). Constipation was another significant clinical manifestation. Her physical examination revealed a characteristic facial structure, including a bulged forehead. Cardiological assessment identified mild mitral valve regurgitation, though her blood pressure remained within normal limits at 110/70 mmHg.

Bone density evaluation through a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan showed a T-score of −2.1 at the left femur neck, consistent with osteopenia. Laboratory tests revealed elevated parathyroid hormone levels at 113 pg/mL (normal range 15-65 pg/mL), while levels of 25-OHD3, 1,25(OH)2D3, phosphorus, and calcitonin were within normal limits. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (2.25 uIU/mL) and free thyroxine (15.85 pmol/L) were unremarkable. Renal ultrasonography findings were normal, and urinary calcium extraction was 150 mg/day (below the threshold of 250 mg/day).

Neck ultrasonography and parathyroid scintigraphy identified a 3-cm right inferior parathyroid adenoma, which was surgically excised. Pathological examination confirmed the preoperative diagnosis.

177,"A 35-year-old woman presented to the medical emergency department with a low-grade fever that had persisted for three weeks, vomiting for one week, and anuria lasting three days. She also reported dysuria and breathlessness for one week. Her history did not include decreased urine output, prior dialysis, or significant symptoms such as weight loss. However, she noted a gradual loss of appetite. Her family history revealed a younger brother who had experienced episodes of smoky-colored urine during childhood but later died in an accident.

On examination, the patient was conscious and alert but showed signs of severe illness. She was febrile, severely pale, and had mild pedal edema. Her blood pressure was elevated at 180/100 mmHg, and her pulse rate was 116 beats per minute. Bibasilar end-inspiratory crepitations were detected in the lungs, along with suprapubic tenderness. A comprehensive evaluation revealed severe bilateral hearing loss, which had been progressively worsening for five years, and pale fundi upon ophthalmological examination.

Investigations indicated severe anemia with a hemoglobin level of 5.7 g/dL, a serum creatinine level of 11.2 mg/dL, and a blood urea level of 325 mg/dL, reflecting significant renal dysfunction. Hypocalcemia was evident, with adjusted serum calcium measured at 5.8 mg/dL. Liver function and iron profile were normal, while urinalysis revealed 35 to 40 red blood cells per high-power field and significant proteinuria.

Ultrasound imaging of the abdomen showed contracted kidneys with increased cortical echogenicity and loss of corticomedullary differentiation, indicative of advanced renal disease. Pure tone audiometry confirmed severe bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. A detailed ophthalmological examination identified anterior and posterior lenticonus in both eyes. Fundoscopic findings included mid-peripheral retinal flecks and blot hemorrhages, suggesting hypertensive changes.

Renal biopsy findings demonstrated focal segmental glomerulonephritis, and electron microscopy revealed disruption of the glomerular basement membrane with thickened capillary walls. A skin biopsy further showed a discontinuous lamina densa with a characteristic basket-weave pattern, consistent with systemic involvement of the condition.

Despite treatment for an associated urinary tract infection and improvements in uremic symptoms, the patient continued to exhibit persistent hematuria and nephrotic-range proteinuria.

She reported no perinatal complications, and her childhood and adolescent development were normal. The myoclonus initially affected her right hand but gradually progressed to involve all four extremities. Within three years of disease onset, she developed a tremulous voice and gait disturbance, which ultimately forced her to discontinue her work as a nurse. She denied symptoms of decreased visual acuity or hearing impairment and had no history of febrile seizures, central nervous system infections, toxic exposures, or herbal drug use. Her 40-year-old younger brother also experienced progressive generalized myoclonus, which was first noted six years earlier, at the age of 34. He exhibited normal intelligence and no visual acuity issues. The rest of the family was reportedly healthy. Physical examination revealed no dysmorphism or hepatomegaly. The patient was alert, oriented, and scored 30 on the Mini-Mental State Examination. She exhibited no gaze palsy, and her vision and hearing were intact.

Biopsies of three prominent lesions confirmed BCC, and these were treated with ED&C. Imaging studies revealed calcifications of the tentorium and falx cerebelli, bridging of the sella turcica, and two unilocular posterior maxillary cysts consistent with odontogenic keratocysts. Other imaging findings included a normal chest X-ray and a pelvic ultrasound without ovarian fibromas. Diagnostic criteria confirmed the underlying condition, supported by genetic testing that identified a pathogenic PTCH1 mutation. She began treatment with vismodegib, an oral selective SMO inhibitor, leading to an initial reduction in lesion size and no new skin lesions for 11 months. However, subsequent treatment periods were marked by recurrent and progressively numerous BCC lesions, requiring various interventions, including Mohs surgery and ED&C.

180,"A 38-year-old man presented with generalized tonic-clonic seizures and altered consciousness, prompting referral from a rural hospital. Initial brain imaging revealed a well-defined, heterogeneous, hypodense lesion in the left frontal lobe with subtle leptomeningeal enhancement. Despite treatment with intravenous antibiotics for a presumed abscess, there was no significant change in lesion size. Further MRI evaluation revealed a high-grade glioma.  

The patient reported facial lesions present since his early twenties, which had progressively enlarged over the past year. Examination revealed coarse facial features, a prominent brow, and multiple shiny blue-black papules, plaques, and nodules concentrated in the periorbital regions. Some lesions displayed raised borders and central ulceration.  

Ophthalmic assessment identified firm, yellow papules protruding from the palpebral conjunctiva on both eyelids. Intraoral examination showed mild swelling in the left mandibular area. Radiographic imaging of the jaws indicated radiolucent lesions consistent with jaw cysts in both the mandible and maxilla. Additionally, brain imaging revealed linear calcification of the falx cerebri. Systemic evaluation for skeletal and cardiovascular anomalies yielded no other significant findings.  

Pathological evaluation confirmed basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in the facial lesions, while eyelid lesions contained keratin flakes. The final diagnosis was confirmed as nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome based on excessive BCCs and falx cerebri calcifications. Facial cancers were surgically excised, with pathology confirming nodular and superficial BCC subtypes.  

The patient refused surgical intervention for jaw cysts and glioma. Anticonvulsants and analgesics were prescribed to manage seizures and headaches.

Their father had bilateral angular lesions at the age of 66 but remained untreated and passed away two years later due to cardiovascular disease. The proband’s mother exhibited no similar clinical symptoms and is now deceased. 

Clinical examination revealed speech and non-verbal communication impairments in the proband. Macrocephaly, excessive growth, and obesity were observed in both the proband (head circumference: 66 cm) and his younger brother (head circumference: 69 cm). Skin examination identified multiple firm, flesh-colored papillary lesions in the interdigital spaces of the palms, axillae, and groin regions. These systemic and localized findings were visually documented, with photographs illustrating the lesions and physical characteristics of the proband and affected family members.","FKM","PTEN","yes","COWDEN SYNDROME","158350","201.0","

The child was born at 9 months of intrauterine life via normal delivery, and his developmental milestones were delayed post-birth. His mother had an uneventful antenatal history, and the patient is the only child of his parents. Physical examination revealed short stature, with his height, weight, and head circumference below the 3rd percentile. Notably, the patient had a triangular head, a flat thenar eminence on the right hand with an absent right thumb, and generalized hyperpigmentation with café-au-lait spots. Abdominal ultrasound revealed the absence of the right kidney, and there was outward projection of the umbilicus, though not a hernia. Developmental delays and learning disabilities were also observed. Laboratory investigations revealed pancytopenia with anisocytosis on peripheral smear, a hemoglobin level of 4 g/dL, and a platelet count of 20,000/µL, which improved following PRBC and platelet transfusions. Bone marrow examination was inconclusive due to hypoplasticity. Further diagnostic work-up showed the presence of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) on echocardiography, and X-rays of the chest revealed bilateral infiltrates consistent with pneumonia. The patient was started on IV antibiotics, which were later discontinued as respiratory distress improved. Inhaled oxygen was gradually tapered as the patient’s condition stabilized. X-ray imaging of the right arm showed the absence of the radius bone, bowing of the ulna, and clinodactyly, along with the absent right thumb, while the left arm was normal.

201,"A 4-year-old male, the second child of non-consanguineous parents from Greenland, presented with a range of congenital abnormalities and symptoms. He was born two weeks preterm with a hiatus hernia, which caused an increased respiratory rate during feeding. This necessitated transfer to the University Hospital Copenhagen, Rigshospitalet, at four days of age. Dysmorphic facial features were identified, including low-set and large ears, underdeveloped antihelix in the right ear, a tall forehead, a broad nasal bridge, anteverted nares, a broad and long frenulum labii superior, retrognathia, and micrognathia without cleft palate. His incisors were visible at birth.

The child has moderate-to-severe non-progressive sensorineural hearing impairment with a conductive component and has been using hearing aids since age four. Imaging studies, including MRI at six months of age, showed normal inner ear and vestibulocochlear nerve configuration, with no brain abnormalities. His neurologic development has been normal. Other systems, including extremities, thorax, genitalia, skin, and abdomen, are normal. His mother reports a history of asthma.

Ophthalmic abnormalities were significant. Bilateral congenital ptosis was surgically corrected at age two using bilateral brow suspension with fascia lata. He was born with bilateral white cataracts that were surgically removed in the first two months of life, leaving both eyes aphakic. Additional features include bilateral inferior iris coloboma, iridocorneal synechia, microcornea with stromal thickening and corneal clouding, and microphthalmia. At the latest follow-up at age four, his binocular best-corrected visual acuity was 20/130, accompanied by nystagmus.

205,"A 53-year-old Brazilian female patient presented to the oral medicine service at the Federal University of Goiás in Goiânia, Brazil, with a primary complaint of dry mouth persisting for two years. She also reported the presence of papular lesions in the mouth, although she was unable to specify their onset. Her medical history included iron deficiency anemia, a thyroidectomy performed at the age of 20 for an unspecified cause, and severe periodontitis leading to complete tooth extraction. There was no significant contribution from socioeconomic or family history.

On physical examination, distinct extraoral findings were noted, including a “narrow bird-like” facial structure, occipitofrontal macrocephaly, a cervical scar from the prior thyroidectomy, a fibrous nodule on the left ear helix, and acral keratosis with warty papules on the dorsum of the hands. Intraoral evaluation revealed total edentulism and multiple sessile, smooth-surfaced, white-to-pink papules under 4 mm in diameter. These papules, distributed over the alveolar ridges, tongue, buccal mucosa, and commissures, exhibited a cobblestone pattern and were asymptomatic. Creamy white plaques on the tongue's lateral borders and the soft palate were removable upon gentle scraping, leaving an erythematous mucosal surface beneath, clinically resembling pseudomembranous candidiasis. 

Laboratory investigations confirmed iron deficiency anemia, for which oral iron supplementation (120 mg/day for four months) was initiated. A biopsy of the papillomatous oral lesions showed histopathological features of hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, elongated rete ridges, and fibrous connective tissue hyperplasia, consistent with papillary fibroepithelial hyperplasia. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated strong nuclear staining for PTEN in all epithelial extracts, intense staining for mutated p53 in most epithelial cells, and a larger presence of dendritic cells identified by S-100. The findings for Bcl-2 and Ki-67 were comparable to controls.

208,"A 58-year-old man was referred for surgical management following five years of treatment-resistant hypercalcemia. His calcium levels ranged from 11.1 to 13 mg/dL, accompanied by elevated intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. Initial imaging using sestamibi scanning at an external facility was inconclusive. At referral, the patient's sister provided a history of neck surgery during infancy for hypercalcemia, though details were unverifiable due to lack of records and their parents’ dementia. The review of systems was notable for worsening fatigue and nocturia.

On physical examination, the patient displayed a cheerful demeanor, small facial features, webbing of the neck, mild cognitive impairment, a well-healed cervical scar, and short stature. His past medical history included hypertension, osteoporosis, chronic kidney disease, recurrent cystitis necessitating bladder procedures, hypothyroidism, prior cerebrovascular accident, and hyperlipidemia. He denied any known familial history of similar conditions. Biochemical testing confirmed hypercalcemia at 12.1 mg/dL, elevated PTH at 95 pg/mL, and normal 25-hydroxyvitamin D at 53 ng/mL. Bone densitometry revealed significant osteoporosis with a forearm T-score of -3.6. Ultrasound and Tc-99m sestamibi imaging indicated bilateral inferior parathyroid gland enlargement. Screening for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 was normal, and laryngoscopic evaluation showed intact vocal cord movement.

The patient underwent re-operative parathyroid exploration, resulting in the resection of a 133-mg right inferior parathyroid gland. Histopathology identified noncaseating granulomatous lymph nodes bilaterally. The left superior gland was biopsy-confirmed as normal. Despite the surgery, hypercalcemia persisted, with marginal intra-operative PTH reduction (83 to 70 pg/mL). Follow-up calcium and PTH levels remained elevated at 11.8 mg/dL and 79 pg/mL, respectively, and repeat imaging was non-revealing.

Postoperatively, the patient experienced recurrent hospitalizations for nephrolithiasis, altered mental status, and dehydration, with peak calcium levels of 16.1 mg/dL managed through intravenous pamidronate, Sensipar, and hydration. Genetic testing ruled out familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia. His physical features and developmental history eventually led to a diagnosis of WBS, confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis. Repeat imaging identified abnormal uptake near the left carotid artery, and fine-needle aspiration confirmed elevated PTH levels exceeding 2,500 pg/mL with undetectable thyroglobulin.

A second re-operative procedure 18 months later identified and resected a 1.5-cm parathyroid nodule deep to the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Pathology reported a 1,523-mg hypercellular parathyroid gland with fibrosis, but no definitive signs of carcinoma. Postoperatively, calcium levels normalized and remained stable for 25 months, with a slight improvement in bone density (T-score of -2.9).

Extraoral examination revealed a broad nasal ridge, hypertelorism, and an enlarged head circumference, along with a dermoid cyst on the patient’s hand. No palpable lymph nodes were noted. Intraoral examination showed non-tender swelling with a bony hard consistency and no tooth mobility. Radiographic imaging and CT scans revealed extensive radiolucent lesions in both sides of the mandible, initially diagnosed as OKCs, with the first diagnosis made in 2010. The patient underwent an incisional biopsy and surgical drainage at that time. In December 2010, the patient returned with purulent discharge from the mandible, and in January 2014, he presented with bilateral facial swelling. Radiographs showed well-defined radiolucent lesions with corticated margins resembling a soap-bubble appearance. Differential diagnoses included unicystic ameloblastoma, OKC, and multiple myeloma. Histopathological examination of an incisional biopsy revealed a cystic lesion lined by parakeratinized stratified squamous epithelium with surface corrugation, basal cell palisading, and columnar basal cells exhibiting polarity reversal. The connective tissue was fibrotic, with visible blood vessels and odontogenic epithelial islands. Based on these findings, the diagnosis was confirmed as OKC.

212,"A 5-year-old boy with developmental delay presented to the outpatient department with generalized body swelling for one month and seizures that had occurred for two days prior to admission. He was born full term but was small-for-gestational age to consanguineous parents. His developmental milestones were delayed in comparison to his chronological age. His medical history did not indicate any significant ante- or perinatal complications, though he had one healthy sibling and a stillbirth.

Physical examination revealed an edematous, short-statured child, with a height of 72 cm (less than the 5th percentile) and evident microcephaly, with an occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) of 41 cm (less than 3 standard deviations). His vital signs remained stable initially, but his blood pressure increased above the 95th percentile for his age, reaching 140/95 mmHg. The child had distinct facial dysmorphism, including a high narrow forehead, almond-shaped eyes, large low-set ears, micrognathia, high-arched palate, and malocclusion of teeth. Neurological assessment showed generalized hypotonia, with reflexes that were difficult to elicit. Over time, the child developed hemiplegia. Fundoscopy was conducted to exclude chorioretinitis, a possible manifestation of TORCH infections, which had been considered as a differential diagnosis. Anasarca and scrotal swelling were also noted.

Biochemical workup revealed nephrotic-range proteinuria, with a urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio of 9.6, hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin of 1.6 g/dL), and hypercholesterolemia (serum cholesterol of 565 mg/dL). Initial evaluations included normal renal function tests, serum electrolytes, blood calcium levels, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Both barium swallow and CT brain scans were performed to detect any associated esophageal or brain malformations, but none were found. Electroencephalogram (EEG), skeletal survey, and TORCH screening were all unremarkable. A renal biopsy was planned to confirm either Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) or Diffuse Mesangial Sclerosis (DMS), two common renal pathologies associated with this condition. However, as the child developed fulminant septicemia, refractory convulsions, and worsening hemiplegia, the biopsy was postponed. He was treated with antibiotics and steroids (both oral and methylprednisolone pulses) to address the infection and nephrotic syndrome. Additional supportive care included anticonvulsants, antihypertensive agents, and parental counseling regarding the disease prognosis.","FKM","YRDC","yes","Galloway syndrome","619609","2065.0","

214,"A 5-year-old girl was referred to a pediatric cardiologist due to the presence of heart murmurs. Clinical examination revealed a systolic heart murmur graded at 2-3/6, most prominent at the right upper sternal border with radiation to the right cervical region. She exhibited distinctive facial features, including a prominent forehead. Speech difficulties were noted; although the patient demonstrated a good auditory rote memory and could follow instructions, her ability to articulate words and construct sentences was impaired.

Echocardiographic evaluation identified mild supraaortic valve stenosis alongside mild supravalvar and peripheral pulmonary stenosis. Subsequent angiographic studies confirmed these findings, highlighting mild supraaortic stenosis, multiple peripheral pulmonary stenoses, and bilateral renal artery stenoses. Hemodynamic measurements during cardiac catheterization showed a left ventricular pressure of 150/0–10 mmHg and an aortic blood pressure of 120/60 (80) mmHg distal to the supravalvar stenosis.

Genetic evaluation was conducted due to clinical suspicion of a specific genetic syndrome. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis revealed a deletion at 7q11.2, confirming the diagnosis.

The patient is currently under clinical observation, given the normal hemodynamic parameters, absence of cardiac hypertrophy, and lack of heart failure symptoms. Follow-up includes periodic echocardiography to monitor for progression of stenosis.

216,"a 5-year-old male, was first seen in the pediatric dentistry sector at the Secretariat of Health of Barueri, São Paulo, Brazil, where he presented with a range of medical issues. Notably, he exhibited facial asymmetry, bilateral ear malformations, hearing loss, agenesis of the right kidney, nail clubbing, and cryptorchidism. Additionally, he had paralysis of the esophagus and trachea, umbilical hernia, laryngotracheomalacia, genital anomalies, and recurrent chronic lung disease. From birth, the patient was fed parenterally due to feeding difficulties. Despite these significant health challenges, no cryptophthalmia was observed.

The patient was referred for dental examination in 2000 following multiple hospitalizations for chronic lung disease related to his condition. His mother reported no consanguinity with her husband and mentioned that a younger sibling was unaffected by the syndrome. During the early stages of treatment, the patient was unable to engage with the oral health team due to serious mental retardation, which delayed targeted therapy. However, after approximately three years, the patient began establishing contact with the dental team and actively participated in consultations.

In the clinical evaluation, the patient was in the mixed dentition stage, and radiographic images revealed the presence of all permanent teeth with intact periodontal support, although marginal gingivitis was present. The oral examination also showed biofilm on the tooth surfaces and supragingival dental calculus, particularly in the upper and lower posterior regions and the lower anterior region.

Treatment focused initially on reducing recurrent bouts of pneumonia, and the protocol involved antimicrobial therapy with 0.12% chlorhexidine, followed by the manual removal of tartar. To prevent the aspiration of tartar fragments during the cleaning process, high-powered suction was used to aspirate the fragments. Post-procedure, 2% chlorhexidine gel was applied to reduce bacterial load in the oral cavity. The family was trained to assist in oral care, using a mouth opener for brushing, as the patient had difficulty opening his mouth.

In addition to oral care, the patient’s dental treatment included periodic radiographic monitoring of the deciduous and permanent teeth. The protocol required monitoring the balance between rhizolysis and rhizogenesis to determine when extractions were needed due to advanced rhizolysis. The patient’s treatment also addressed the risk of aspirating permanent teeth as they emerged. Home-based care was supplemented by the mother’s active participation in oral hygiene, using a toothbrush without toothpaste to avoid pulmonary complications.

Over the course of the 8-year follow-up period, the patient's periodontal condition improved, and he no longer required hospitalization for chronic lung disease. In 2013, as the patient acquired permanent dentition and entered puberty, the focus of treatment shifted to controlling periodontal disease, with monthly consultations continuing as the patient remained under observation.

219,"A 68-year-old man presented with the recent onset of tenderness and paraesthesia localized to the left jaw. His medical history included multiple surgical procedures to remove skin lesions and jaw cysts. However, precise details regarding these interventions, including the histological characteristics of the removed lesions, were unavailable.

On physical examination, the patient exhibited significant sequelae from a previous right mandibulectomy, which involved resection of the ramus mandibulae and condylectomy, followed by reconstruction with the iliac crest. These surgical outcomes resulted in marked facial disfigurement. Additional findings included multiple surgical scars, hypertelorism, mild bilateral lagophthalmos with associated epiphora, and absence of lower eyelashes. A suspicious lesion on the left auricle, potentially indicative of basal cell carcinoma, was also noted. Neurological examination confirmed dysethesia affecting the left side of the face, aligning with the distribution of the trigeminal nerve.

Radiological investigations, including orthopantomogram and facial CT scan, revealed prior surgical changes, cystic formations within the sinus cavities causing thinning of adjacent orbital, maxillary, and nasal walls, and a satellite cyst in the left mandibular angle. The latter had caused initial osteolytic lesions in the contiguous cortical bone. Additionally, calcifications of the cerebri falx were identified.

The patient underwent surgical enucleation of the mandibular cyst and excision of the auricular skin lesion. Histopathological analysis determined the cyst to be a benign odontogenic keratocyst and confirmed the auricular lesion as basal cell carcinoma. Following surgery, he was advised to adhere to intensive clinical and instrumental follow-up protocols, avoid prolonged unprotected sun exposure, and arrange genetic testing and evaluations for his children to determine any hereditary risks associated with his condition.","FKM","PTCH1","yes","Basal cell nevus syndrome","109400","377.0","

220,"A 6-month-old female patient presented to our department for evaluation following the identification of subglottic stenosis during intubation for an ophthalmological procedure. Since birth, multiple congenital malformations were observed, including cloacal and urogenital anomalies, syndactyly affecting all four limbs, a short neck, cryptophthalmos, bilateral symblepharon, absence of eyebrows and eyelashes, a broad nasal bridge with a bifid tip, and stenosis of the external auditory canals.

In the operating room, direct laryngoscopy revealed a congenital glottic web type III, according to Cohen's classification, along with a severe subglottic stenosis graded as III on the Cotton-Myer scale. A tracheostomy was performed to maintain the airway. Following a second surgery, a cold division of the anterior laryngeal web, combined with an open laryngotracheal reconstruction (including cricotracheal resection, posterior cricoid split, costal cartilage augmentation, and end-to-end anastomosis), was completed. A silastic stent was placed for two weeks, after which an adequate airway permeability was achieved. However, one month later, a new anterior glottic web developed, which led to further surgical intervention involving the division of the web, topical application of mitomycin C, and the placement of a silastic stent for three weeks. Post-stent removal, endoscopic controls confirmed good airway permeability, and the patient was successfully decannulated. Four years later, the patient remains decannulated without ventilatory compromise.

224,"A 6-year-old male child was referred to our pediatric cardiology clinic due to a cardiac murmur detected during his physical examination. The child had been started on clarithromycin treatment six days prior, following a diagnosis of atypical pneumonia. During the clinical history, it was revealed that the patient had experienced a short-duration syncope attack approximately 12 hours before his clinic visit. There was no familial history of unexplained sudden deaths at younger ages or previous episodes of syncope.

On physical examination, the child appeared in good general condition, was conscious, and showed normal vital signs with a cardiac rate of 94 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 100/70 mmHg. A 2/6 systolic murmur was noted in the mesocardiac area. The physical examination of other systems did not reveal any abnormalities. Laboratory tests, including complete blood count (CBC) and biochemistry, were within normal limits.

An electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 88 beats per minute, a normal axis, a QRS duration of 60 milliseconds, and a QT interval of 480 milliseconds, which was prolonged for his age. The corrected QT interval (cQT) was measured at 600 milliseconds. No T-wave abnormalities or dysrhythmias were observed (Figure 1). An echocardiogram revealed normal cardiac structure and function.

A 24-hour Holter ECG monitoring revealed no rhythm abnormalities, except for the prolonged QT interval. Given the absence of a family history of similar symptoms and normal electrocardiographic findings in the parents, as well as normal audiometric testing, congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) was excluded. Considering the patient’s recent clarithromycin treatment, we hypothesized that the medication may have been the causative factor. The child was advised to stop the medication, and one week later, the QT interval normalized to 420 milliseconds.

225,"A 72-year-old woman was referred to our institution for acute liver failure. Her medical history included rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, both managed with methotrexate for one year. She reported no history of alcohol consumption, recreational drug use, or nonprescription supplement use, and there was no family history of liver disease. She initially presented at another hospital with acute pancreatitis. Admission liver tests showed total bilirubin at 0.7 mg/dL, direct bilirubin at 0.3 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase at 125 U/L, alanine aminotransferase at 94 U/L, alkaline phosphatase at 468 U/L, and an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.3. The cause of her pancreatitis remained undetermined despite extensive evaluation.

During hospitalization, her liver function progressively worsened. Concerns regarding possible drug-induced liver injury prompted treatment with intravenous methylprednisone and N-acetylcysteine, but her condition continued to decline. A transjugular liver biopsy revealed findings of steatohepatitis, minimal fibrosis (1a/4), cholestasis, and anisonucleosis. A liver biopsy sample was sent for quantitative copper analysis.

She was subsequently transferred to our facility with ongoing liver dysfunction. Initial management assumed methotrexate-induced hepatotoxicity. Over the course of her hospitalization, she developed complications, including hemolytic anemia, acute renal failure, altered mental status, and worsening jaundice. Additional evaluation included an ophthalmologic exam for characteristic eye findings, which yielded inconclusive results, and brain magnetic resonance imaging, which the patient declined. Laboratory tests revealed a serum copper level of 79 μg/dL, 24-hour urinary copper excretion of 31 μg/24 hr (with a glomerular filtration rate of 34 mL/min/1.73 m²), and ceruloplasmin at 14 mg/dL. Non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper measured 37 μg/dL, and hepatic copper concentration was elevated at 298 μg Cu/g. Other laboratory evaluations for acute liver failure returned unremarkable results.

Despite supportive care, her condition continued to deteriorate. The combination of low ceruloplasmin levels, biopsy findings, equivocal ophthalmologic results, and elevated hepatic copper levels raised concern for an underlying metabolic condition. She was urgently evaluated for liver transplantation. Unfortunately, her condition was further complicated by anuric renal failure and hypoxic respiratory failure, ultimately resulting in her death in the intensive care unit. At the time of her death, laboratory values showed further derangement, with total bilirubin at 34.7 mg/dL, direct bilirubin at 30.8 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase at 124 U/L, alanine aminotransferase at 38 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase at 475 U/L.

Born to consanguineous parents, she was delivered at full term, with healthy parents reporting no prior medical history. The child exhibited developmental delays and had previously undergone uneventful anesthesia for orthopedic hand surgery and lingual frenectomy on three occasions. Her mother reported a history of obstructive sleep apnea. Laboratory investigations, including Complete Blood Cell Count, Blood Urea Nitrogen, Creatinine, PT, PTT, and INR, were normal. Echocardiography revealed no cardiac anomalies. Physical examination highlighted distinct orofacial and limb abnormalities, including oral cavity deformities, tongue nodules, missing central incisors, a high-arched palate, a broad nose, midline lip cleft, hypertelorism, low-set ears, and limb deformities. Bilateral polydactyly of the hands, previously corrected in earlier surgeries, and bilateral preaxial and postaxial polydactyly of the feet were noted. Surgery was planned to address the mirror foot deformity of the right foot. Anesthesia was induced with lidocaine, fentanyl, and propofol, and the procedure was conducted without muscle relaxants. Direct laryngoscopy revealed a bifid uvula and dorsal port of the vocal cords. The 94-minute procedure involved the excision of preaxial and postaxial rays to create a functional foot for shoe use.

239,"A four-and-a-half-year-old female child presented with concerns regarding the absence of speech and failure to learn. The elder of two siblings in a healthy family, she was born at full term via normal delivery, weighing 3100 g with a head circumference of 33 cm. Early developmental milestones were considered late but within the normal range; she sat at eight months, walked at 14 months, and developed a vocabulary of approximately 20 words by 28 months, progressing to three- to four-word sentences by 30 months. However, around the same time, a regression was noted—she lost her speech and experienced a decline in fine motor skills. While she retained basic abilities such as eating with a spoon and some form of pincer grasp, constructive play ceased. Her expressive speech devolved into unintelligible sounds and screams, and her comprehension of speech became impaired but not absent. Despite delays in achieving sphincter control, she communicated her needs through vocalization or signs of discomfort. She exhibited midline purposeless hand movements such as wringing, clapping, and mouthing, alongside episodic hyperventilation, teeth grinding, and facial grimacing. She maintained eye contact and showed no aversion to physical contact. Physical examination revealed short stature, overweight status, and a head circumference of 46.5 cm, with no dysmorphic features or structural deformities. She walked and ran independently with a wide-based gait and no history of falls. No seizures were reported, and EEG findings were unremarkable. An MRI scan revealed no structural brain abnormalities.

240,"A four-year-old girl presented to the developmental assessment clinic with a history of abnormal movements affecting the entire body since the age of two years, which remained uncontrolled despite treatment with antiepileptic medications, including phenobarbitone and sodium valproate. She was the firstborn child, with no history of pregnancy loss and an uneventful antenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum period. Her birth weight was 2700 grams, and developmental milestones were appropriate up to the age of two years, during which she could climb stairs, use a few meaningful words, maintain bowel and bladder control, and feed herself. At two years of age, she experienced a generalized tonic-clonic seizure lasting 10 minutes, which recurred 2-3 times monthly. Initial treatment with phenobarbitone was ineffective, and she was switched to sodium valproate at 40 mg/kg, which controlled the seizures. 

Following the onset of seizures, she experienced a gradual regression in previously attained milestones. She lost the ability to perform purposeful hand movements and developed stereotypic behaviors such as slapping her face and wriggling her hands. Social withdrawal, communication difficulties, and regression in motor and language skills ensued, with an inability to recognize her parents or engage with her surroundings. Additional symptoms included continuous drooling, biting toys, spitting at objects, and an ataxic gait with frequent falls. She also lost bowel and bladder control.

249,"A pregnant woman was referred to the cardiology clinic in 2009 due to premature ventricular complexes (PVCs). She had a history of two miscarriages in earlier pregnancies, with suspected cervical insufficiency as the cause, leading to a cerclage insertion in her current pregnancy to prevent preterm birth. The patient experienced palpitations and was found to have an abnormal ECG showing PVCs, atrioventricular (AV) 2:1 block, and QT prolongation (520 msec) during sinus rhythm at 90 beats per minute. Ambulatory ECG monitoring revealed frequent PVCs (10% of the time) and three runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Long QT syndrome (LQTS) was suspected, though echocardiography excluded structural heart disease. The patient also reported anxiety, particularly related to the healthcare environment.

Her ECG findings, including QT >500 msec and T-wave abnormalities, raised concerns for an increased risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD), especially given her family history of her mother's sudden death at 36 years of age after strenuous exercise. To address this, the patient underwent implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), which proceeded without complications. This decision was made with careful consideration to minimize radiation exposure to protect the unborn child. The ICD was programmed to detect tachycardia at a threshold of 240 bpm and deliver shocks if necessary. Following implantation, genetic testing confirmed the presence of a mutation in the SCN5A gene, which confirmed the diagnosis of LQTS in the patient.

Despite initial concerns about hypotension and the fetus, beta-blocker therapy was later considered but ultimately declined by the patient. She had a history of loss of consciousness episodes during her adolescence, which were initially thought to be seizures, but with the new diagnosis of LQTS, these episodes were reconsidered as syncopal events. The patient continued taking phenytoin for her epilepsy, which was believed to help with her arrhythmias due to its effects on sodium channels. Her pregnancy progressed without significant complications, and she gave birth to a son, who was also diagnosed with LQTS through genetic testing. Cascade screening of family members revealed additional cases of the condition.

The patient's recovery after delivery was uneventful, and her ICD continued to monitor for arrhythmias, with only occasional PVCs detected. Over seven years of follow-up, no appropriate shocks or other complications occurred. However, four years after her initial genetic evaluation, further testing revealed an additional mutation associated with LQTS type 1, leading to a diagnosis of double mutations (LQTS types 1 and 3). Despite being protected by her ICD, the patient found her situation stressful and struggled with the emotional burden of living with the condition. Although she was supported by her family and healthcare providers, she took sick leave from her administrative work due to the ongoing stress.","FKM","CACNA1C","yes","LONG QT SYNDROME","618447","65283.0","

The infant, the second-born child of healthy, non-consanguineous parents, had a healthy five-year-old elder sibling. During the antenatal period, ultrasound scans revealed multiple limb anomalies indicative of a potential skeletal dysplasia. The infant was born after an uneventful pregnancy, with a birth weight of 2.54 kg. At seven months of age, the anthropometric measurements, including weight, occipitofrontal circumference, and height, were all less than -3 standard deviations for the chronological age, highlighting significant growth retardation.

He exhibited a tendency to bruise easily with minor trauma, although there was no history of internal organ bleeding. The patient came from a non-consanguineous family and had an unaffected brother and sister.

On examination, the best corrected monocular visual acuity was 20/200 in both eyes. Due to the presence of nystagmus, monocular vision was measured by fogging the fellow eye with +6 D overcorrection. Binocular visual acuity was 20/160 when fusion was maintained. Refraction revealed +10.00-4.00×10° in the right eye and +9.00-4.00×160° in the left eye. Horizontal jerk nystagmus and 50 prism diopters of intermittent exotropia were evident. Examination of the green irides showed marked transillumination. Fundoscopic findings included hypopigmentation of the fundi and foveal hypoplasia.

Laboratory investigations identified a platelet storage-pool defect with prolonged bleeding time and abnormal platelet aggregation studies. Prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet counts were within normal limits. Platelet aggregometry revealed a severe platelet release defect characterized by low ADP and an increased ATP/ADP ratio. A panel of platelet agonists, including collagen, ADP, and ristocetin, confirmed storage-pool and secretion defects. Von Willebrand factor activity was 76%, von Willebrand antigen was 68%, and factor VIII activity was 55%, all within normal limits. Tyrosinase activity was not assessed.

To address the exotropia, surgical intervention was performed with precautions, including the reservation of platelet concentrates for potential hemorrhagic events. A 10 mm recession of both lateral recti reduced exotropia to 35 prism diopters postoperatively. A second procedure, involving a 6 mm resection of both medial rectus muscles, achieved near orthophoria. Visual acuity improved to 20/120, and nystagmus was reduced both subjectively and objectively.

255,"An 11-year-old boy presented on September 18, 1975, with a noticeable swelling on the right side of his face. On external examination, the swelling appeared expansive and involved the underlying bone. Intraoral evaluation revealed two distinct bony swellings on the buccal side of the right maxilla and mandible. His occlusion was classified as an edge-to-edge bite. Other notable physical findings included a bifid uvula and a high-arched palate.

Radiographic imaging further characterized the condition: a panoramic X-ray showed multiple cystic lesions in both the maxilla and mandible, while cranial radiographs revealed frontal and parietal bossing, alongside mild mandibular protrusion. Chest X-rays identified additional anomalies, including a rudimentary sixth cervical rib and flaring at the tip of the left third rib. Measurements indicated an increased canthal index of 41 compared to the normal value of 38. The plantar skin displayed numerous small depressions, diagnosed histologically as pitted keratolysis. Two pigmented nevoid lesions on the abdominal skin were identified as lentigines without signs of carcinomatous transformation.

Family history revealed similar findings in the boy's brother, who had previously been treated for cystic lesions in the mandible and maxilla, as well as frontal and parietal bossing, a bifid fifth rib, and a high-arched palate. Imaging of their father showed calcifications of the falx cerebri, skull bossing, and cystic lesions in the mandible. The father had also been described as having an unusually large skull with frontal and parietal bossing.

Given the patient’s age and the multiple large cysts with associated tooth impaction and displacement, surgical marsupialization was recommended. The initial procedure, performed in October 1975, involved excising the buccal walls of the maxillary cysts to establish communication with the oral cavity. The cyst contents were greasy and cheese-like, resembling keratocysts. Histological analysis confirmed these as dentigerous keratocysts.

Subsequent procedures were performed to address mandibular cysts in March 1976, removing buccal bone in the right canine region. Similar findings were noted. Additional marsupialization procedures were conducted later that year to treat the remaining and recurring cysts.

257,"an 18-year-old female who presented with a complaint of painful decayed teeth. She reported experiencing pain for the past month and had received medication for the issue. On general examination, the patient exhibited poor orientation, short stature, and intellectual challenges. Extraoral examination revealed several classical features, including a brachycephalic skull shape, flat facial appearance with ocular hypertelorism, slanting palpebral fissures, saddle nose deformity, midfacial underdevelopment with underdeveloped nasal bones, and flattening of the nasal bridge. Additionally, a retruded maxilla was noted, resulting in a protruded mandible.

Examination of the extremities showed broad fingers and palms, as well as broad toes and wide spacing between the first and second toes. Intraoral examination revealed multiple decayed teeth, including root stumps and a few missing teeth. Specifically, tooth 36 had a sinus opening with pus discharge on the buccal aspect. The tongue appeared fissured and larger than normal (macroglossia), protruding during mastication. Overall, poor oral hygiene was noted, contributing to periodontitis.

Radiographic findings included a panoramic radiograph that showed multiple decayed teeth with evident periapical abscesses and a few missing teeth. There was also a generalized reduction in alveolar bone height, extending below the middle third of the roots of most teeth, indicative of vertical bone loss. A lateral skull view revealed a hypoplastic maxilla, with underdevelopment of the middle third of the face, leading to a prognathic mandible.","FKM","RCAN1","yes","Down syndrome","190685","870.0","

260,"An 8-year-old male child, born to non-consanguineous parents, presented with a one-week history of abdominal distension. Six months prior, the child had experienced jaundice (yellowing of the skin and sclera), which resolved following treatment with unspecified Ayurvedic medications. There was no associated fever during the jaundice episode. The child had no significant medical or family history, and his parents were in good health. Upon physical examination, the child exhibited signs of pallor and jaundice. His vital signs were within normal limits, except for blood pressure readings above the 99th percentile systolic and 95th percentile diastolic. Abdominal examination revealed hepatomegaly with a liver span of 13 cm, moderate ascites with shifting dullness, and no fluid thrill. The abdominal girth was 68 cm at the time of presentation. Ophthalmologic evaluation showed a greenish-brown ring at the Descemet’s membrane level on slit-lamp examination, suggestive of a Kayser-Fleischer ring, though there were no associated symptoms such as oscillations, gaze paresis, or accommodative insufficiency. There was no history of night blindness or ocular trauma, and no intraocular copper foreign body was observed. Laboratory tests showed decreased serum albumin, an albumin-to-globulin ratio of less than 1, mildly elevated serum transaminases, slightly increased total bilirubin with direct bilirubin above 50%, and abnormal prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Kidney function tests were normal, and routine urine analysis was within the expected range. Hematologic analysis revealed low hemoglobin, thrombocytopenia, normal white blood cell count, and macrocytic anemia, as confirmed by a peripheral smear. Serum vitamin B12 levels were decreased. Considering the clinical presentation, a diagnosis of Wilson’s Disease (WD) was suspected. Serum ceruloplasmin was found to be 16 mg/dL, and the 24-hour urinary copper level was elevated at 800 µg/L. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed coarse liver echotexture, hepatomegaly, and normal portal vein and inferior vena cava diameters. Treatment was initiated with zinc sulfate (75 mg/day) and D-penicillamine (10 mg/kg/day), the latter taken on an empty stomach with a six-hour interval between zinc and the chelator, along with pyridoxine (25 mg/day). The child’s hemogram was closely monitored for signs of bone marrow depression, a potential side effect of D-penicillamine.

Examination revealed a cup-to-disc (C/D) vertical ratio of 0.6 in the right eye and 0.5 in the left, with vitreous degeneration in both eyes. Fundus photography showed a tigroid appearance in both eyes and a macular coloboma in the right eye. Additionally, midfacial hypoplasia was noted, though hearing was normal. The child was born via cesarean section at 36 weeks gestation, weighing 2,800 g, and required oxygen shortly after birth, although further details were unavailable. There was no history of congenital infection during the pregnancy, and no relevant family history was reported. A diagnosis of Stickler syndrome type I was suspected, and DNA sequencing was recommended but declined by the parents. Periodic fundus examination was advised, but follow-up was not possible due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Two years later, the boy was referred with severe vision loss in his right eye. Comprehensive fundus examinations revealed retinal detachment (RRD) with dialysis of the ora serrata in the right eye, and his BCVA had deteriorated to light perception in the right eye and 0.2 in the left. Signs of high myopia persisted, and the macular coloboma remained in the right eye. Unusually, multiple retinal macrocysts were observed in the inferior retina, with fluorescein leakage in the right eye. DNA sequencing revealed a pathogenic point mutation (c.1693C>T; p.Arg565Cys) in exon 26 of the COL2A1 gene, confirming the diagnosis of Stickler syndrome type I, with the mutation appearing to be a de novo variant. The patient underwent pars plana vitrectomy, followed by posterior vitreous detachment, photocoagulation, cryotherapy, and silicone oil injection for retinal reattachment. A mini-incision was made for vesicular drainage of the macrocysts. Postoperatively, the patient maintained a face-down position for 1 month. Fundus examination one week after surgery showed a reattached retina with silicone oil tamponade.

Signs of rickets were present, including rachitic rosary, pectus excavatum, Harrison sulcus, genu valgum, and wide metaphyses of the wrist. Additional features included a pot belly, generalized hypotonia, and short stature. Biochemical tests suggested renal rickets, with normal serum vitamin D levels, low calcium and phosphorus, and very high alkaline phosphatase. Investigations of renal function revealed a proximal tubular defect, indicated by low urinary specific gravity, glycosuria, bicarbonaturia, phosphaturia, and proteinuria.

Audiometric assessments, initiated due to initial abnormal hearing screening results, revealed bilateral hearing loss, which progressed to mild sensorineural impairment at age 8. Ophthalmologic evaluations identified significant myopia, with worsening visual acuity over time, accompanied by vitreous thickening and myopic staphyloma in both eyes. The child also displayed multiple dysmorphic features, such as epicanthus, midface hypoplasia, small and mildly depressed nasal bridge, micrognathia, and a high, narrow palate. Additional musculoskeletal findings included mild joint hyperlaxity, pectus carinatum, winged scapulae, and bilateral flat feet. No familial history of similar symptoms was noted, although the mother had other health conditions like fibromyalgia and celiac disease.

282,"The patient investigation revealed a case within a Chinese family, wherein clinical symptoms, genetic analysis, and pathological findings were comprehensively evaluated. The proband, a 13-year-old male, presented with a history of persistent hematuria for over eight years and progressive visual deterioration in the left eye due to retinal detachment. Laboratory tests showed significant proteinuria (2.8 g/24 h) and abnormal glomerular basement membrane (GBM) structure upon renal biopsy. Pedigree analysis indicated a hereditary pattern involving multiple family members across generations, with manifestations ranging from isolated hematuria and proteinuria to renal insufficiency and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Whole-exome sequencing identified two heterozygous mutations in the COL4A3 gene, with one mutation (c.2603G>A; p.G868E) considered the primary pathogenic factor contributing to the observed renal and ocular abnormalities. This mutation, along with a secondary auxiliary mutation (c.583G>A; p.G195S), revealed variable expressivity of symptoms among family members. The findings emphasize the utility of genetic diagnostics in early detection and personalized management, underscoring the need for interventions such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) to delay disease progression.","FKM","COL4A3","yes","Alport syndrome","104200","63.0","

She experienced neonatal hypotonia and cardiac alterations, including an atrial septal defect and aortic coarctation, both of which were surgically corrected. Additionally, she has a history of Arnold-Chiari malformation type 1 with associated hydro syringomyelia, which required surgery at the age of 10. She has had subclinical hypothyroidism since birth, managed with Levothyroxine from age 4. The patient experienced hypoglycemia until age 3, requiring feeding interventions. Early childhood was marked by feeding difficulties, including gastroesophageal reflux. She displays typical facial features, including hypertelorism, everted lower eyelids, a short columella, a depressed nasal tip, and low-set ears. Her medical history includes repeated acute otitis media and urinary tract infections with vesical-ureteral reflux, although she is currently asymptomatic. Immunodeficiency is noted, with deficiencies in IgA and IgG and a reversal of the CD4/CD8 ratio. The patient also has mild hyperopia, mild intellectual disability, delayed psychomotor development, hypodontia, and a bifid uvula. Her genetic diagnosis reveals a de novo MML2 gene disruption (c.14361dup/p.Val4788Serfs*29).

286,"The patient is a 40-year-old male with a long history of health issues, initially diagnosed with a connective tissue disorder at the age of 17, a diagnosis that has never been refuted. He was born at 44 weeks of gestation with no reported perinatal distress, though his psychomotor development was delayed. At 6 years old, he developed idiopathic generalized epilepsy, which was well-controlled with anti-epileptic drugs, and brain MRI did not show any abnormalities. The severity of his seizures gradually decreased, allowing for the cessation of therapy by the age of 13. During childhood, generalized joint hypermobility (JHM) was noted, which was complicated by two episodes of joint dislocation. A heart ultrasound performed at age 40 revealed mitral valve prolapse without valve insufficiency and mild aortic bulb dilation (4.34 cm, z-score 3.93), though prior cardiac evaluations were unavailable. At 40 years old, clinical assessment revealed moderate cognitive impairment, with a global IQ of 48, as assessed by the WAIS-R. Other symptoms included anxiety, poor eye contact, and difficulty performing daily activities. Physical examination revealed facial dysmorphisms, xerosis on the lower limbs, absence of JHM according to the Beighton score, and several skeletal alterations, including scoliosis, cubitus valgus, and other minor skeletal asymmetries. His height was slightly below the genetic target (163 cm, with a target of 171 cm based on parental height), and his BMI was within the normal range (22). While typical cutaneous signs of a connective tissue disorder, such as skin hyperextensibility and atrophic scars, were absent, the patient did not meet the clinical criteria for the disorder. Further investigation through microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) identified a 546-kb deletion in 17q21.31, encompassing five genes linked to a microdeletion syndrome.

287,"The patient is a 54-year-old male with a complex medical history and a presentation indicative of multiple chronic conditions. Born to unrelated parents, his gestation and delivery were unremarkable, and his birth weight was 2.6 kg. Developmentally, delays in speech and motor functions were noted before he reached one year of age, accompanied by sleep disturbances. Behavioral issues emerged during childhood and adolescence, including aggression, self-injurious tendencies, and onychotillomania. He was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and intellectual disability (ID). Childhood symptoms also included polyembolokoilamania, scratching wounds, and hearing issues. He underwent corrective surgery for cryptorchidism and was diagnosed with myopia.

At 36 years, the patient exhibited unique physical characteristics such as short stature, moderate to severe hair loss, facial asymmetry, skeletal anomalies, premature skin aging, scars, and dysplastic nails. Behavioral observations included stereotypical hand movements. Over time, he developed postural instability, bradykinesia, tremors, and rigidity. Initial evaluations misattributed these symptoms to epilepsy, but subsequent investigations identified features consistent with early-onset motor impairments. 

Genetic testing revealed a small deletion in the 17p11.2 region, including the RAI1 gene, confirmed via fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). His karyotype was normal. Despite initial treatment with valproic acid for presumed seizures, symptoms persisted. By age 49, his symptoms worsened, leading to a formal diagnosis of motor-related conditions, and treatment with levodopa/carbidopa yielded significant improvements.

The patient currently resides in an institutional care setting for individuals with intellectual impairments. He continues to exhibit stereotypical behaviors, self-injury, and occasional falls, necessitating protective gear such as a helmet and a posture-correcting vest. His diet is modified to accommodate dental issues, focusing on mashed foods and liquids. His BMI is 18.4, reflecting underweight status. Routine evaluations show stable liver function despite elevated enzymes, attributed to medication-induced cirrhosis confirmed via biopsy and imaging. Additional findings include hepatosplenomegaly, portal hypertension, minor normocytic anemia, and a stable minor pericardial effusion.

Despite his challenges, the patient engages socially and exhibits polite behavior, with moments of interest in toys and cell phone games. His care includes regular clinical evaluations, a hyperproteic diet, and medications for managing symptoms and comorbidities.

The newborn had respiratory distress from birth, and the mother, Aleya, had been diagnosed with gestational diabetes during the last trimester of pregnancy, but there was no history of insulin use for control. The mother had received homeopathic treatment during the first trimester. There was no history of consanguinity in the marriage. The baby was delivered by a lower uterine caesarean section at Mitford Hospital. On examination, the baby appeared to be a term infant weighing 4700 gm, but both eyes appeared to be anophthalmic. The baby exhibited dysmorphic features, including a small nose with hypoplastic nares, a broad and depressed nasal bridge, and syndactyly of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th fingers on both hands. Additionally, there was chordee, a condition affecting the genitalia. The baby also had tachypnea, though the first and second heart sounds were normal, with a systolic murmur audible in the left second intercostal space. The occipitofrontal circumference was measured at 37 cm. The baby was initially diagnosed as an infant of a diabetic mother with mild perinatal asphyxia and multiple congenital anomalies.

On investigation, the baby's hemoglobin level was 13.8 gm/dl, and the total white blood cell (WBC) count was 16,000/cmm, with a normal differential count. Blood sugar levels were monitored and found to be within the normal range. Testing for TORCH antibodies showed a positive IgG result only. A chest X-ray was normal, but Doppler echocardiography revealed mild pulmonary stenosis. An ultrasound of the brain and abdomen showed no abnormalities. Karyotyping was recommended, but the parents could not afford it. The baby was referred to the ophthalmology department, where a bilateral cryptophthalmos (hidden eyes) was diagnosed, and no eyelashes were present.

During this time, an atypical high-arched palate was noted, along with persistent hypoglycemia, which reached 27 mg/dL and required multiple boluses of intravenous dextrose. Blood gas analysis revealed metabolic acidosis. Blood investigations showed normal serum insulin levels in the context of hypoglycemia, suggesting hyperinsulinemia, while other hormone levels were within normal limits. The patient was discharged in stable condition with oral diazoxide. Further investigations, including organic acid and metabolic disease tests, returned normal results. An MRI of the brain revealed hypoplasia of the corpus callosum. The patient was later admitted to the PICU for poor feeding, failure to thrive, persistent hypoglycemia, and acidemia. Nasogastric tube feeding was initiated and continued for four days, and the patient was discharged on NGT feeding with sodium bicarbonate.

291,"The patient was a 13-year-old boy who first experienced a seizure at the age of 7, in November 2015. The seizure initially presented with a sudden fear-like feeling without an obvious trigger, followed by systemic rigidity and limb twitching, lasting approximately 2–3 minutes. The episode resolved naturally. He was taken to a local hospital, though the specific treatment provided remained unclear. A second seizure occurred on March 9, 2016, with similar symptoms and occasional progression to secondary generalized tonic–clonic seizures. The patient was diagnosed with focal motor seizures with impaired awareness and focal progression to bilateral tonic–clonic seizures. Treatment with valproic acid was initiated on March 25, 2016, with a gradual increase to a dose of 5 ml every 12 hours, corresponding to 16 mg/kg per day for his weight of 24 kg. However, seizures continued, and on July 20, 2016, the therapy was adjusted to include both valproic acid and levetiracetam. On May 13, 2017, the patient experienced another seizure along with symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The treatment regimen was modified to include valproic acid (same dosage as before) and oxcarbazepine, with the initial dose of oxcarbazepine set at 0.075 mg every 12 hours, later increased to 0.15 mg every 12 hours. This combination therapy continued for over a year until August 2018, when the patient’s family refused further dose adjustments due to concerns about side effects. Despite this, the patient continued to experience one seizure every 5–12 months.

On August 12, 2021, the patient had another clinical attack, presenting with sudden unconsciousness. There were no reports of vomiting, chest tightness, or chest pain before or after the episode. An ECG conducted at a third-level grade-A hospital in Xi'an revealed a significant prolongation of the QT interval (QTc). EEG recorded during the same period did not show abnormalities, and a diagnosis of long QT syndrome (LQTS) was suspected. Following this, the antiepileptic medications were discontinued, although the cessation was not authorized by a doctor. On August 18, a Holter ECG revealed torsades de pointes (TdP) twice, with QTc reaching 770 ms. Given the suspected LQTS, all antiepileptic drugs were discontinued. Six days later, on August 21, the patient had a recurrence of seizures, occurring four times within 24 hours. The seizures were characterized by fear, tight holding of others, vocalizations, and limb exertion, followed by limb convulsions lasting 2–3 minutes, with spontaneous resolution and normalization of consciousness. ECG monitoring during this episode showed a normal QT interval. After discussing the patient’s condition with his guardian, the decision was made to resume antiepileptic drug therapy, with valproic acid (sustained release 0.5, every 12 hours, corresponding to 32 mg/kg per day) and levetiracetam (0.25, every 12 hours, corresponding to 16 mg/kg per day). This treatment successfully controlled the seizures. Genetic testing for LQTS-related gene variations, conducted via AmpSeq multiple PCR high-throughput sequencing on September 9, revealed no related mutations. Follow-up on September 22 confirmed no further seizures and showed normal QT intervals on ECG.

Auxiliary examinations included routine blood tests in March 2016, revealing normal levels of white blood cells, red blood cells, platelets, liver enzymes, and kidney function markers. The ECG at that time showed sinus tachycardia, and cranial MRI was normal. A video-EEG conducted on September 9, 2017, revealed spikes in the left central, parietal, and parieto-occipital regions during the interictal phase. On August 12, 2021, an ECG showed prolonged QT/QTc intervals (607 ms), with significant T wave abnormalities. Holter ECG on August 19 confirmed torsades de pointes and a prolonged QTc interval of 770 ms. Blood tests during this period showed stable results for electrolytes, liver and kidney function, and myocardial enzymes. Subsequent ECG monitoring on August 21 showed a normalization of the QT interval.","FKM","CACNA1C","yes","LONG QT SYNDROME","618447","65283.0","

292,"The patient was a 50-year-old woman who had been noted to have a slightly large head since childhood but was never diagnosed with mental retardation. At the age of 39, she presented with bilateral breast masses, which upon biopsy were identified as bilateral invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. A subsequent whole-body examination revealed cerebellar tumors and hydrocephalus. Additionally, multiple polyps were detected in her stomach and large intestine. She underwent resection of a left cerebellar tumor at the age of 40, and pathological analysis confirmed the presence of hamartomas. 

Her medical history was marked by a series of significant health events. At the age of 41, she developed depression due to difficulties in finding employment after her surgery and received psychiatric treatment with gradual improvement. At 43, she experienced incomplete hemiplegia of the right upper and lower extremities, which led to the identification of a dural arteriovenous fistula. This condition necessitated three transvenous embolization procedures. By 45, she had relocated and continued her follow-up care at multiple departments, eventually undergoing a right thyroid lobe resection at age 46 for a mass identified as an adenomatous goiter. Later that year, she was diagnosed with recurrent breast cancer with left-rib metastasis and initiated hormonal therapy. 

The patient's family history was notable. Her older sister had been clinically diagnosed with a related syndrome at another institution, and her father, though undiagnosed, exhibited symptoms consistent with the condition, such as macrocephaly, hydrocephalus, and multifocal oral mucosal papillomatosis. This pattern suggested a strong familial predisposition. 

Upon physical examination, she was conscious and stable, with a head circumference of 61 cm and multifocal oral mucosal papillomatosis. Her laboratory and imaging findings were largely unremarkable, except for her known surgical history. Genetic testing revealed a likely pathogenic variant in the PTEN gene, confirming the genetic basis of her condition. This variant led to splicing abnormalities and the production of aberrant messenger RNAs, resulting in impaired protein synthesis.

Surveillance for associated conditions, including uterine, renal, and colorectal cancers, was planned. Genetic counseling and consultations with specialists informed her ongoing management.

299,"The patient, a G1P1 male, was born via cesarean section at 38+4 weeks gestation with a birth weight of 3,380 g, head circumference of 32.5 cm, and body length of 50 cm. Apgar scores at 1, 5, and 10 minutes were 8, 9, and 9, respectively. Immediately after birth, the patient displayed tachypnea, irregular breathing, perioral cyanosis, nasal flaring, tracheal tugging, and groaning. Coarse crackles were heard in both lungs, and the heart rate was 180 bpm, with a 2/6 systolic murmur along the left sternal border. The patient showed normal limb tone, and primitive reflexes were present. The prenatal history revealed a diagnosis of mild maternal anemia and a fetal ultrasound at 23 weeks indicating a ventricular septal defect (VSD), atrial septal defect (ASD), and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), alongside right ventricular and atrial enlargement with mild tricuspid valve regurgitation. Postnatal imaging confirmed these findings, along with pulmonary hypertension and a significant thickening of the interventricular septum. The patient developed hypoglycemia, jaundice, and electrolyte imbalances. Blood tests showed elevated lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, and infection markers. Exome sequencing identified a de novo heterozygous mutation in the KMT2D gene, which was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The patient was treated for respiratory distress with endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, and for heart failure with digoxin and milrinone. He was discharged after stabilization, with a diagnosis of moderate meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), neonatal respiratory failure, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, congenital heart defects, pericardial effusion, hyponatremia, hypophosphatemia, and a KMT2D gene mutation.","FKM","KMT2D","yes","KABUKI SYNDROME","147920","2322.0","

300,"The patient, a male, was evaluated at 8 years of age due to language delay and learning difficulties. He was born at term, with multiple café-au-lait spots present since birth. Gross motor development was slightly delayed, as he began walking independently at 20 months. His language development was delayed, and he faced learning difficulties in school. Notably, there was no history of recurrent or severe infections, and he had never been hospitalized. The patient was the fourth child of healthy, nonconsanguineous parents from the same village in Morocco. A history of premature deaths among distant family members and a report of developmental delay in a first cousin were noted.

On physical examination, the patient had mild dysmorphic features, including a broad and depressed nasal bridge and multiple café-au-lait spots. His nonverbal IQ, assessed by the Leiter-R scale, was 65. Audiometric testing and ophthalmological evaluation were both normal. A brain MRI revealed a large arachnoid cyst in the right temporal region, displacing the temporal lobe and lateral ventricle. Cytogenetic testing showed characteristic chromosomal rearrangements involving chromosomes 1 and 16, raising suspicion of an underlying disorder.

Molecular investigations identified a homozygous missense mutation in the ZBTB24 gene (c.1222T>G), confirming a diagnosis of ICF2 syndrome. Although the patient exhibited reduced serum IgM levels, he did not demonstrate clinical signs of immunodeficiency. Immunological testing revealed normal serum levels of IgA, IgG, and IgG subclasses, but low IgM. Lymphocyte subsets, including T helper, cytotoxic T cells, B lymphocytes, and natural killer cells, were within normal ranges.

Despite the patient's non-specific facial dysmorphisms and mild cognitive impairment, he did not present typical clinical features of immunodeficiency. This case underscores that immunodeficiency may not always be present in ICF2 syndrome, and brain malformations could potentially be an overlooked feature of this condition. The presence of the cerebral cyst may be coincidental, but further investigation into the possible link between ZBTB24 mutations and cerebral development is warranted.","FKM","DNMT3B","yes","IMMUNODEFICIENCY-CENTROMERIC INSTABILITY-FACIAL ANOMALIES SYNDROME 1; ICF1","242860","2268.0","

She has hypertelorism, epicanthus, low-set ears, a flat facial profile, anteverted nares, cleft palate, and prognathism. Additionally, she has missing second incisors in the upper jaw. She experienced severe hearing impairment, confirmed by brain stem audiometry at 1.5 years of age, and has been using hearing aids. Psychomotor development was reported to be normal. She underwent surgery for an inguinal hernia at age three and a tonsillectomy at age 4.5.

Her ophthalmic abnormalities include bilateral congenital cataracts, which were extracted at six months of age, leaving her aphakic. Other findings include congenital ptosis, microphthalmia, and microcornea. Ophthalmoscopic examination at six months revealed normal optic nerve heads with peripapillary atrophy affecting the macula in the right eye. By age 15, abnormalities of the optic nerve heads, papillary pigmentation, and vascular changes were noted. Visual fields were concentrically restricted without scotomas by age 21, and she began prophylactic treatment for elevated intraocular pressure. At 25 years, ultrasound revealed posterior vitreous detachment, posterior pole thickening, and posterior staphyloma.

In response to recommendations, he underwent orthopantomogram and CT imaging of the dental arches. These investigations revealed mild hypertelorism and the presence of jaw cysts, raising concerns for a hereditary condition.

Genetic analysis identified a mutation consistent with a specific syndrome. Despite these findings, the son had no clinical symptoms or functional impairments attributable to the condition at the time of evaluation.

A physician at the reference center suspected the diagnosis of LDS based on the patient's medical history. However, the patient's hearing loss and extensive skeletal involvement led to a more pronounced phenotype than typically observed in LDS. A second opinion was obtained from a clinical geneticist, who confirmed the presence of arachnodactyly, mild short stature, pectus carinatum, bifid uvula, micrognathia, hypertelorism, down-slanting palpebral fissures, and wide, atrophic scars. High throughput sequencing identified two sequence variants: a novel missense mutation in the TGFBR2 gene and a likely pathogenic nonsense mutation in COL2A1.

309,"The proband, a 1-day-old female newborn, was one of three sisters born from a twin gestation with known anorectal malformations (ARMs) in a small town in China. The mother, a 33-year-old with a history of a prior spontaneous birth, experienced a spontaneous pregnancy confirmed as a triplet gestation via transabdominal ultrasound. Prenatal tests, including Nuchal Translucency (NT) and amniocentesis, were not conducted, but no abnormalities were noted in glucose tolerance, amniotic fluid levels, fetal heart monitoring, or blood pressure. 

Premature rupture of membranes led to an emergency cesarean section on the fourth day of the 34th week, delivering the dichorionic triamniotic triplets. Following birth, all siblings were diagnosed with anal stenosis, and the third triplet exhibited syndactyly of the second and third left toes. Prematurity necessitated immediate admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Screening tests, including chest X-rays, abdominal and transfontanellar ultrasounds, hearing assessments (aTEOAE and aABR), and abdominal radiography, were largely normal aside from intestinal dilation and pulmonary hypertension in the second and third triplets. Notably, all triplets exhibited defecation through the vagina, suggesting rectovaginal fistulas. While posterior rectal advancement anoplasty was delayed, a barium enema to localize the fistulas was not performed due to limited resources.

Family history revealed a pattern of related malformations: the father, born with imperforate anus, thumb deformities, and moderate hearing loss, underwent anorectoplasty and did not require hearing aids. The grandmother had moderate hearing loss, while her brother reportedly had anal atresia and finger deformities, although contact with him was lost.

339,"We report a case of a newborn male who was delivered spontaneously at term on June 29, 2015, to a 27-year-old mother with gestational diabetes A1. The Apgar score was 9 at one minute and 10 at five minutes after birth. The newborn had a birth weight of 3142 grams, a head circumference of 35 cm, and a length of 47 cm. Vital signs at birth were stable, with a pulse of 118 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 72 breaths per minute, a systolic blood pressure of 69 mmHg, a diastolic blood pressure of 34 mmHg, and blood oxygen saturation of 100%.

At the age of two days, the newborn was admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) due to persistent tachypnea, with a respiratory rate reaching up to 88 breaths per minute, mild hypotonia, and tracheomalacia. Initial laboratory investigations, including a complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, biochemistry, thyroid function tests, and two blood cultures, were all within normal ranges. Comprehensive clinical examinations were conducted, including chest X-rays, electroencephalogram (EEG), cranial ultrasound, and echocardiography, which revealed no abnormalities. Neurological examination showed normal reflexes such as plantar grasp, Moro, and sucking reflexes, with the exception of mild hypotonia. 

During the hospitalization, the newborn developed feeding difficulties, necessitating the insertion of a peripheral venous catheter in the left leg. Further metabolic investigations, including measurements of blood ammonia, lactate, amino acids, organic acids, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amino acids, yielded normal results. Following 22 days of monitoring and care, the patient's condition improved significantly, and he was discharged with recommendations for regular pediatric follow-up. However, intermittent tachypnea persisted, with rates ranging from 72 to 77 breaths per minute. 

In addition to tachypnea and mild hypotonia, the child exhibited feeding difficulties, sleep disturbances, and mild dysmorphic facial features, such as a flat, broad nasal bridge and a small mandible. Based on these persistent symptoms, suspicion of an underlying genetic abnormality was raised. Chromosomal analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing were conducted, leading to the identification of an interstitial deletion on chromosome 17p11.2.

Currently, the child is under regular follow-up in a pediatric outpatient clinic every three months. His overall condition has improved, with no feeding difficulties and a normal respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute.

He visited the emergency department with vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and generalized pallor. Laboratory findings included mild leukopenia (4120 white blood cells/mL with 31% neutrophils and 53% lymphocytes), severe anemia (hemoglobin 5.4 g/dL), normal platelet count, and impaired kidney function (creatinine 4 mg/dL, urea 94 mg/dL, and GFR 14 mL/min/1.73 m²). He also exhibited hypercalcemia (10.6 mg/dL), hyperphosphatemia (10.2 mg/dL), low parathyroid hormone (4.7 pg/mL), and elevated urine calcium/creatinine ratio (0.8), with normal pH, bicarbonate, sodium, potassium, albumin, and vitamin D levels.

Imaging revealed bilateral nephrocalcinosis on kidney ultrasound and normal cardiothoracic ratio on chest X-ray. A blood smear was consistent with anemia of chronic disease, without atypical cells. Initial management involved volume expansion with saline solution and red blood cell transfusion. Additional measures included sevelamer carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, erythropoietin, and folic acid for chronic kidney impairment. A kidney biopsy confirmed nephrocalcinosis without other underlying conditions.

Suspecting ABCD syndrome, calcium intake was reduced, water intake was increased, and dietary modifications were implemented with a low-calcium formula. Despite initial improvement, the patient was rehospitalized twice due to hypercalcemia (up to 13.7 mg/dL). Methylprednisolone was introduced to reduce vitamin D activation and calcium absorption, but the response was suboptimal.

Imaging revealed bilateral nephrocalcinosis. Based on prior patient management experience, ABCD syndrome was suspected. The patient was hospitalized, formula and oral hydration were discontinued, and calcemia normalized to 9.9 mg/dL within 48 hours. Reintroduction of an extensively hydrolyzed formula containing 200 mg/day of calcium led to a recurrence of mild hypercalcemia (10.7 mg/dL), confirming the diagnosis.

342,"An 11-month-old male infant presented to the hospital with persistent vomiting, reduced oral intake, and decreased urine output. His medical history included prematurity at 30 weeks’ gestation as part of a twin pregnancy and a genetic condition diagnosed at four weeks of age. For two months prior, he had experienced intermittent spit-ups that led to changes in his formula. Despite these adjustments, the spit-ups increased in frequency and severity, becoming uncontrollable after feedings two days before admission. On presentation, the infant was afebrile but exhibited a rapid heart rate of 189 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. Growth measurements indicated a weight and length below the fifth percentile.

Physical examination revealed fatigue, dry mucous membranes, delayed capillary refill, and characteristic facial features associated with his genetic condition. Laboratory studies showed normal levels of sodium, potassium, and chloride, but an acute kidney injury (AKI) was identified with elevated blood urea nitrogen (55 mg/dL) and creatinine (0.9 mg/dL). Serum calcium was markedly elevated at 14 mg/dL. Fluid resuscitation resolved the AKI, but calcium levels remained high at 12.9 mg/dL, prompting admission for further management.

Endocrine evaluation revealed low parathyroid hormone (PTH) at 5.7 pg/mL, with normal thyroid-stimulating hormone, free T4, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was low at 73 U/L, ruling out conditions like hypophosphatasia. Elevated parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) at 15.3 pmol/L raised concerns for malignancy. Further evaluations, including imaging and laboratory markers for neuroblastoma, revealed no evidence of cancer. A skeletal survey confirmed normal bone mineralization. Urinary studies showed increased calcium excretion, and a renal ultrasound indicated bilateral medullary nephrocalcinosis.

The infant's hypercalcemia was managed with calcitonin, a low-calcium and vitamin D-free formula, potassium phosphate, and sodium citrate/citric acid to address nephrocalcinosis.

347,"An 8-year-old boy presented for a comprehensive eye examination due to parental concerns regarding letter reversals, letter additions, and an occasional eye misalignment when the child experienced frustration. The child, enrolled in a special education program, exhibited academic performance below the expected levels. His parents noted an eye turn over the past 3-4 years but were uncertain which eye was affected. A checklist assessing visual skills and perceptual performance revealed positive responses to 19 out of 23 indicators, including headaches, eyestrain, letter/number reversals, and poor reading skills. This was the child’s first eye examination.

The child had a history of asthma, treated without medication, and was on Strattera® and Risperdal® for attention and aggression-related issues. Recently, a psychologist identified autistic tendencies in the child, but no occupational or physical therapy interventions had been initiated. The child’s ocular family history included the need for corrective lenses; his father was highly farsighted, and two maternal uncles wore thick glasses. His mother had astigmatism and suboptimal visual acuity despite corrective lenses. No family history of eye misalignment was reported.

Upon examination, the child’s unaided visual acuities were measured as 20/70 in the right eye, 20/50 in the left eye, and 20/60 binocularly at a distance, with near acuities of 20/125 in the right eye, 20/40 in the left eye, and 20/40 binocularly. A convergence deficit was noted, with break and recovery at 3 cm and 8 cm, respectively. A cover test showed orthophoria at a distance and 6 exophoria at near. Stereopsis testing indicated a result of approximately 3,000 seconds of arc, and pupillary reflexes, confrontation fields, and most extraocular movements were normal. However, there was a restriction in superior gaze in the right eye, which was most pronounced in left gaze.

High hyperopic astigmatism was identified in both eyes, with corrected visual acuities of 20/100 in the right eye and 20/60 in the left eye. General observations included hypertelorism and downward-slanting palpebral fissures. Posterior segment evaluation revealed retinal vessel tortuosity, with no other abnormalities. The child was diagnosed with anisometropic amblyopia due to compound hyperopic astigmatism and a superior elevation deficit in the right eye. The family was informed about the visual condition, the potential for improvement with glasses, and the plan for follow-up evaluation in six weeks for additional testing and potential perceptual examination.","FKM","FGD1","yes","Aarskog syndrome","305400","915.0","

A 12-year-old Indian boy visited a dental clinic with the chief concern of crowded front teeth in both upper and lower jaws. The patient was observed to be shorter than average for his age. Examination revealed distinct facial features, including a large head with frontal prominence, a slight gap in the fontanelle, a triangular scalp hairline, low-set ears, wide-spaced eyes, a broad-nosed bridge with a stubby appearance, and forward-tilted nostrils. Intraoral examination indicated underdeveloped jaws and anterior crowding of teeth. Seventeen baby teeth remained in both the upper and lower jaws, alongside a few permanent teeth.  

The patient’s medical history noted prior surgery to correct a flat nasal bridge. His father reported concerns about a small genital organ. Physical examination confirmed buried genital anatomy and undescended testes. Additional examination revealed small feet and underdeveloped terminal phalanges of all fingers, along with shortened middle phalanges of the fifth fingers on both hands. Radiographic evaluation showed enlarged pulp chambers and short roots in the teeth, indicative of a structural anomaly.

Despite the findings, the patient declined tooth extraction or orthodontic treatment.","FKM","FGD1","yes","Aarskog syndrome","305400","915.0","

349,"The proband was referred to the clinical unit at 16 months for a diagnostic evaluation of short stature and atypical facial features. He is the second child of healthy, unrelated parents of Italian origin. He has eight siblings, including two brothers who exhibit similar clinical traits. These siblings have led normal lives and achieved adult heights of 150 cm and 152 cm.

The patient was born at 38 weeks via a scheduled caesarean section, with a birth weight of 2930 g, a length of 48 cm, and a head circumference of 36 cm. Apgar scores were 7 and 10 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. At birth, he presented with flexed hands, congenital talipes equinovarus, and ectopic testis. The talipes equinovarus was successfully treated using the Ponseti method, and the ectopic testis was surgically corrected at 9 months. While developmental milestones were achieved within normal ranges, his growth remained suboptimal.

At his initial evaluation, the patient displayed good social interaction and overall fair health. Measurements revealed a weight of 8.5 kg (3rd percentile), height of 72 cm (<3 SDs), and head circumference of 49 cm (75th percentile). Subsequent assessments showed consistent growth challenges, with height and weight measurements remaining below the 3rd percentile, though head circumference was relatively preserved (50th–75th percentile).

Craniofacial anomalies included thin hair, a widow’s peak, rounded face, high forehead, chubby cheeks, telecanthus, hypertelorism, ptosis (more prominent on the right), downward-slanting palpebral fissures, a short nose with anteverted nostrils, a broad nasal bridge, a wide philtrum, small teeth, thin lips, an underdeveloped maxilla, and a small jaw. Ear anomalies included low-set ears with bifid and thickened lobes.

The hands were short, broad, and flexible, with a low thumb implant, short and flexed fifth fingers showing clinodactyly, partial syndactyly of the second to fourth fingers, interphalangeal joint contractures, and dyschromic, hypoplastic nails. Feet were short and broad with enlarged toes. Additional findings included pectus excavatum, inguinal hernia, and a shawl scrotum.

Laboratory tests, including metabolic panels, thyroid function tests, and imaging studies, were normal. Skeletal X-rays showed short and broad metacarpal nuclei with mild dysmorphism. Brain MRI and EEG evaluations were unremarkable. Neuropsychiatric assessments indicated mild motor and language delays.

Genetic analyses revealed an FGD1 gene variant (c.1828C>T) and a 16p13.11-p12.3 microduplication of 2.5 Mb, both of maternal origin. These findings were instrumental in understanding the underlying etiology and suggested an X-linked inheritance pattern consistent with familial phenotypic traits.","FKM","FGD1","yes","Aarskog syndrome","305400","915.0","

350,"An 11-year-and-5-month-old boy was admitted to the hospital due to complications following a previous surgical procedure for undescended testicles. He was born at full term, weighing 2,500 g and measuring 48 cm, with no complications at birth. The parents are non-consanguineous, with no notable family history of genetic disorders, and are in good health. Approximately five years prior, the boy was diagnosed with an empty scrotum on both sides, with non-palpable testicles, and underwent corrective surgery. Before a subsequent surgery, it was noted that both testicles had retracted, with the left testicle showing atrophy and the right testicle palpable in the groin area, measuring approximately 2.7×0.9×0.8 cm. At admission, his weight (30 kg) and height (133.8 cm) were below the 3rd percentile, and he exhibited a round face, wide-spaced eyes, a broad nasal bridge, a curved linear dimple below the lower lip, a typical scrotal fold, repaired undescended testicles, brachydactyly, joint laxity, broad and flat feet, and hyperextensible finger joints. Routine blood tests for liver and kidney function, glucose, and electrolytes were normal, but hormonal analysis revealed low testosterone levels and elevated follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), indicating gonadal dysfunction. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Children’s Hospital of the Capital Institute of Pediatrics (Approval No. SHERLL2019025), and written informed consent was obtained from the parents, adhering to the Helsinki Declaration (revised in 2013).","FKM","FGD1","yes","Aarskog syndrome","305400","915.0","

The patients were two brothers. The elder brother, aged 7 years and 11 months, and the younger brother, aged 4 years and 9 months, presented with complaints of short stature and multiple deformities. Both were born at full term to non-consanguineous parents, with unremarkable antenatal, birth, and perinatal histories. Growth retardation was noted from the age of one year, but no interventions were undertaken. At admission, the elder brother's height was 109.3 cm (−3.7 SD), and his weight was 21.5 kg (−1.26 SD). The younger brother's height was 100.4 cm (−1.3 SD), and his weight was 14.6 kg (−1.3 SD). Physical examination of the elder brother revealed a short, uniformly proportioned body with features such as small hands and feet, short and thick fingers and toes, short curved little fingers, and single palmar creases. Additional findings included distinctive facial features, inguinal hernia, cryptorchidism, a sacral tail skin depression, and a long response time with hyperactive behavior and difficulty concentrating.

The younger brother exhibited proportionate short stature, small hands and feet, short and thick digits, short curved little fingers with single creases, and similar facial and skeletal anomalies. He also had a sacral tail skin depression, a flat navel, and a shapeless scrotum. Both brothers underwent thorough laboratory investigations, which showed normal liver and kidney functions, blood parameters, and imaging studies, including echocardiography and pituitary MRI. Bone age assessment for both boys approximated 6 years. Karyotype analysis confirmed 46, XY in both patients.

Genetic testing through trio whole-exome sequencing identified a hemizygous FGD1 gene variant (c.2015+1G>A), inherited from their mother. This splicing variation was classified as pathogenic per ACMG guidelines but had not been previously reported in genetic databases. The family history revealed multiple relatives with similar physical traits, including short stature, bent digits, and mild facial deformities, supporting an X-linked inheritance pattern.

Both patients were treated with long-acting growth hormone at 0.2 mg/kg/week, with parental consent, and monitored over four years. Significant catch-up growth was observed in both siblings. The elder brother’s final height reached 144 cm (−1.31 SD), while the younger brother’s height reached 135 cm (0 SD). This response aligns with earlier studies on growth hormone therapy. These findings expand the known spectrum of FGD1-related variations and contribute to understanding phenotype-genotype correlations in cases of genetic short stature.","FKM","FGD1","yes","Aarskog syndrome","305400","915.0","

352,"The third child of unrelated parents, a female patient, was noted to have a cleft soft palate at birth, which was later surgically repaired. She exhibited facial asymmetry, mandibular retrognathia with an increased vertical facial height, and asymmetry of the feet. Additional findings included an iris coloboma in the left eye. Motor milestones were mildly delayed, and she required special education support during schooling but has since achieved independence and is currently employed. She has moderately severe conductive hearing loss, a radioulnar synostosis at the right elbow, and an open posterior fontanelle in the occipital region.

The patient also had dental abnormalities, including missing upper lateral incisors and lower second premolars. There was a Class III incisor relationship accompanied by an anterior open bite and bilateral crossbite. A history of orthodontic treatment was noted from childhood, provided elsewhere. Corrective treatment included upper and lower preadjusted edgewise fixed appliances and bimaxillary orthognathic surgery, which involved Le Fort 1 differential maxillary impaction, a bilateral sagittal split for mandibular rotation, and advancement genioplasty with vertical reduction.

Initial diagnoses included a condition characterized by multiple anomalies, though a review at the genetic clinic suggested a different syndrome. Chromosomal analysis, including FISH studies for a 22q deletion, showed normal results. The case was deemed likely to represent a new mutation due to the patient's unique presentation and the absence of similar findings in her family.","FKM","TBX22","yes","ABRUZZO-ERICKSON SYNDROME","302905","921.0","

353,"The patient was the first child of non-consanguineous parents from Argentina and the mother had a history of febrile seizures. Following a normal perinatal period, she suffered typical febrile seizures at the age of 11 months. At 18 months old, non-febrile seizures were detected that consisted of a loss of consciousness, neck hypertonicity and tonic upgaze deviation. They lasted a few seconds and occurred several times per day. Video electroencephalographic recordings showed spike-wave and polispike-wave complexes bilaterally in the central-parietal brain areas. She was put on valproic acid, which completely controlled the seizures within two months. Neurological examination at the age of 2 years showed a non-dysmorphic and normocephalic child with adequate language, cognitive and motor development. She had hyperactivity and poor attention span while playing. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no abnormalities, and the patient's karyotype was 46,XX. A metabolic work-up was conducted, detecting high plasma lysine levels, increased serum pipecolic acid values and low plasma ornithine concentrations (Table 1). In the urine, the patient had increased excretion of lysine, arginine, ornithine, homocitrulline and cystine. The amount of lysine in the cerebrospinal fluid was high while the concentrations of arginine and ornithine were low (Table 1). Screening for other inborn metabolic diseases was negative.

355,"Case Description:
This case involves three siblings, two girls and one boy, born to consanguineous parents of Middle Eastern descent. The family history was significant for early-onset liver disease in the children.
The older sister presented at four months of age with hepatosplenomegaly, abdominal bloating, and vomiting. A liver biopsy revealed fibrosis with increased glycogen storage. She remained clinically stable for several years but at 13 years of age presented with cachexia, abdominal pain, and a rapidly enlarging liver mass. Imaging confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with vascular invasion. Despite referral for specialized care, she succumbed to the disease before treatment could be initiated.

The younger sister, who became the proband, presented in infancy with hepatosplenomegaly and mild gastrointestinal symptoms. She showed no significant health issues until 13 years of age, when a routine check revealed a large focal liver lesion during imaging. Laboratory tests revealed significantly elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels (>40,000 ng/mL), but no abnormalities in urine or plasma amino acid profiles, including succinylacetone. 
The younger brother exhibited hepatosplenomegaly during infancy but was monitored closely due to the family history. By the age of 11 years, he developed liver stiffness consistent with stage 2–3 fibrosis. ","Mohammadreza","FAH","Yes","Tyrosinemia Type I (HT-1)","276700","882","PMID: 27397503",,,,

Caesarean section at 36 weeks’ gestation (the indication was
possible twin–twin transfusion syndrome). The patient’s
birth weight was 2.3 kg. No immediate perinatal problems
were reported. At the age of 3, he developed a chest
infection. Routine examination revealed the presence of
hepatosplenomegaly, and he was referred for further inves-
tigations. He had had recurrent chest problems
consisting of a distressing, nonproductive cough unaccom-
panied by fever, which had been treated with frequentcourses of antibiotics with little or no benefit. Developmen-
tally, he had evidence of gross motor delay with delayed
walking, was ataxic and falling frequently, and was trying to
put a few words together. His parents are unrelated—the
father being Egyptian Coptic and the mother Polish. Initial examination revealed marked horizontal- and
vertical-gaze palsy, resulting in ptosis. The other cranial
nerves were intact. Tone and power appeared to be normal,
and there was cerebellar ataxia. The liver was palpable
5 cm and the spleen 8 cm. There were no abnormal
respiratory signs. Coagulation studies were abnormal; a

358,"A 22-year-old white British man with a background of epi- lepsy presented with a 2-week history of worsening nau- sea, vomiting, confusion, and aggressive behavior. On admission, he was encephalopathic and confused with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 14. In view of his deteriorating condition, he was admitted to the acute admissions unit for further investigation.
There was no history of significant illness in infancy or childhood. At the age of 18 while working as a lifeguard, he had a fall and hit his head, following this injury he had a grand mal seizure and was started on anticonvul- sant medication. He had previously tried lamotrigine and levetiracetam but was unable to tolerate the non- neurological side effects. He did not report altered men- tal state on these medications. He had been started on sodium valproate 1 month prior to presentation.
Initial laboratory findings showed his alanine trans- aminase was elevated at 74 iU/L and his white cell count was 12 × 109 /L. C-reactive protein and all other blood tests were within normal ranges. His ammonia level was measured 2 days later and was 120 umol/L (normal range: 12–47 umol/L). Despite weaning down and stop- ping sodium valproate, his ammonia level continued to rise, reaching 230 umol/L. At this time, specific therapy for his hyperammonemia was started.
Plasma amino acids showed a raised glutamine of 1160 umol/L (515–75), consistent with a chronic hyperammone- mia and a low citrulline level of 13 umol/L (20–55), consist- ent with OTC deficiency. Urine organic acids showed a large peak of orotic acid, confirming the diagnosis.
Initially, it was thought that his encephalopathy was secondary to sepsis. It took 48 hours for the ammonia to be checked. The hyperammonemia was initially consid- ered to be simply due to valproate therapy and the drug was stopped. When the ammonia continued to rise, an underlying metabolic disorder was considered.
To reduce the plasma ammonia levels, he was treated with sodium benzoate, sodium phenylbutrate, and L- arginine intravenously. He was also put on a zero pro- tein diet and given intravenous 10% dextrose to prevent catabolism. Once his ammonia levels declined to below 100 umol/L, dietary protein was gradually reintroduced and sodium benzoate, sodium phenylbutrate, and L- arginine were continued orally. He commenced cloba- zam for his epilepsy.
He made a full recovery, with no neurological abnor- mality detected on examination at outpatient follow-up 2 months later. He cut down on his consumption of meat but otherwise follows a normal diet.

359,"Fourteen years ago, our patient was admitted with progressive
new signs and symptoms of heart failure (HF). She had a brother diagnosed with Fabry’s disease who underwent renal
transplantation; however, he died 10 years post-transplant. A
maternal aunt who was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardio-

daughter was an asymptomatic carrier of Fabry’s. She was
diagnosed 3 years before this admission presenting decreased
leukocyte alpha-galactosidase activity, increased urinary
glycolipids, and concentrations of globotriaosylceramide and
galabiosylceramide. 
Her physical examination showed signs of congestive heart
failure. She presented first-degree AV block and IRBBB on
electrocardiogram. The echocardiogram showed marked
LVH, normal systolic function and size of left ventricle, and
moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Her creatinine
clearance significantly reduced at 36 mL/min and 24-h urine
protein of 40 mg, but she did not undergo renal biopsy.
The cardiac MRI showed striking left ventricular wall
thickening and right ventricular hypokinesis. There were
no signs of coronary angiogram. A RV endomyocardial
biopsy (EMB) was carried out and the light microscopy
findings were: myocardial fiber hypertrophy, mild inter-
sticial fibrosis, and periodic acid-Schiff-positive vacuoles
of varying size in many fibers, replacing the sarcoplasm.
Electronic microscopy demonstrated complex, concentric
lamellar bodies characteristic of Fabry’s disease with
many fibers showing marked loss of contractile elements.
She was treated for heart failure and discharged home.
During the follow-up, she rapidly deteriorated from the
heart failure and was listed for heart transplant (HT). The
post-operative period was not complicated. The excised
heart weighted 460 g (normal range 250–300 g). The
myocardium presented patchy firm brown lesions that were

360,"The case was a girl who was 12 months of age at her first visit. Her gestation period was 38 weeks and birth weight was 2524 g. The patient was born by normal delivery without asphyxia. Her weight gain was poor from 6 months of age. She choked easily during lactation and stri- dor was observed. Her parents noticed that she frequently stretched out her lower limbs and threw her head back. She was referred to our hospital at 12 months of age. There was no family medical history of note, and no consanguineous marriage.
At the first visit, her weight was 6780 g (−2.2 SD) and she had re- markable inspiratory stridor when crying but no hoarseness. There was no murmur or cardiac arrhythmia. Her upper abdomen was swol- len and hard. The liver was palpable 6 cm and the spleen 8 cm below the costal margin. There was no redness of the pharynx or enlarged lymph nodes. Neurologically there was an increase in muscle tone, tris- mus, and strabismus. Her patella tendon reflex was slightly enhanced but parachute reflex was not induced. A sitting position was possible, but balancing was difficult. The developmental quotient (DQ) using the Enjoji Developmental Scale was 80 [4].
Laboratory findings at the first visit are shown in Table 1. A decrease in platelets and an increase in acid phosphatase (ACP) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) were observed. Chest X-ray showed an infil- trative shadow and granular shadow in both lung fields with poor per- meability. A head CT scan was normal. The abdominal CT confirmed remarkable hepatosplenomegaly but masses or enlarged lymph nodes were absent. Bone marrow examination showed large cells with wide pale-stained cytoplasm, eccentrically located nuclei and wrinkled cyto- plasm (Fig. 1) considered to be Gaucher cells. The leukocyte β-glucosi- dase activity of the bone marrow culture was 2.8% of normal values (1.5 nmol/mg protein/h).","Farid Zare","GBA","Yes","Gaucher disease, acute neuronopathic form","230900","77260","PMID: 27866810",,,,
361,"A 24-year-old female, initially diagnosed at the age of one year due to developmental delay and seizure activity and following extensive workup at an outside hospital (records not available for review; however, in-house geneticists had been following for three years and concurred with the diagnosis), was hospitalized for bilateral pneumonia in February 2017. Her disease had been primarily managed with Imiglucerase at a dose of 4,000 units every two weeks, weekly albumin infusions, and lacosamide and levetiracetam for seizure control; other than brief lapses due to insurance issues, such as when she moved to the area in 2014, she was reportedly compliant with this therapy. At the time of hospitalization, she complained of numerous gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed hepatosplenomegaly and an abdominal mass (seen as early as 2014 at outside hospitals, per records). Radiological interpretation reported a 3.3 cm partially calcified mesenteric mass tethering of the surrounding soft tissue, small bowel wall thickening, colonic distension, and dilated mesenteric blood vessels. Colonoscopy documented a relatively patent colon with diffusely boggy mucosa. Multiple engorged vessels, likely representing varices, were noted in the transverse colon. The patient was not considered a surgical candidate, and she was stabilized and discharged.
The patient later presented in June 2017 with hematochezia, tachycardia, and hypotension; her hemoglobin was found to be 7.9 g/dL. She was transferred to a tertiary care center, where she stabilized after a red blood cell transfusion. A CT angiogram of her abdomen demonstrated compression of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) with extensive varicosities; this was thought to be secondary to the previously documented mesenteric mass. Further management, such as SMV stent placement, was considered but ultimately decided against due to unclear benefit, and she was discharged after stabilization.
The patient presented again in November 2017 with abdominal pain, intractable vomiting, and poor oral intake. Small bowel obstruction was confirmed via imaging, and she was admitted for further management. Abdominal radiographs documented diffuse distension of the small bowel and colon, but no free air was detected within the peritoneum. A subsequent CT scan showed diffuse mucosal thickening of small bowel loops. Though the imaging obtained during this hospitalization focused on her gastrointestinal disease, radiology reports noted diffuse osteopenia with foci of cortical irregularity. No pathologic fractures or other acute osseous abnormalities were reported. Due to persistent electrolyte abnormalities and acute respiratory failure, she was transferred to a tertiary care facility. Notable laboratory values upon transfer included: hemoglobin 8.7 g/dL, MCV 68 fL, calcium 5 mg/dL, AST 256 U/L, ALT 150 U/L, and total protein 3.6 g/dL; all other pertinent labs were within reference ranges. The bowel obstruction did not resolve with conservative management, so a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube was placed. The team performing this procedure noticed prominent duodenal folds with scattered white spots, and biopsies of this area demonstrated benign small bowel mucosa with prominent macrophages in the lamina propria (Fig. 1). Various immunohistochemical and special stains were obtained to further characterize the biopsy.","Farid Zare","GBA","No","Gaucher disease, chronic neuronopathic form","231000","77261","PMID: 30574629",,,,
362,"She was born by caesarean delivery at full term with no neonatal problems. Family history was positive for epilepsy. She presented with normal development until the age of 4 years. However, at 2 years of age, she had a history of sple- nomegaly for which no conclusive diagnosis was made. At 5 years of age, the patient started to exhibit learn- ing disabilities. Examinations revealed marked cere- bellar dysarthria, ataxia, intention tremor and mild cognitive impairment. At the age of 8 years, she began to develop seizures and learning difficulties.
At the age of 9 years, the patient came to our institution with psychomotor regression, slurred speech, moderate cognitive impairments, ataxia, ptosis, swallowing difficulties, and vertical supranuclear oph- thalmoplegia. To control the seizures, the patient was initially prescribed valproic acid (750 mg/day). Screen- ing for metabolic diseases and other tests, including haematological and biochemical tests, were all nega- tive except for elevated ammonia, cholesterol and plasma chitotriosidase activities. The hyperammonae- mia could have been associated with the use of val- proate (Wadzinski et al 2007). Abdominal ultrasound scans showed splenomegaly despite the fact that there was no visceromegaly in the clinical examination.

363,"A girl, the fourth child of consanguineous parents (first cousins), was born at 38 weeks of gestation after a pregnancy complicated by polyhydramnios. Birth weight was 2180 g (< 3rd percentile), length 47 cm (∼10th percentile), head circumference 30 cm (< 3rd percentile), and APGAR score 8/9. One brother, born at term, and one premature sister, had both died 6 h(presumed perinatal asphyxia) and two days (cause not reported), respectively, after birth. Ultrasound images of the fourth child showed agenesis of the corpus callosum and mild bilateral pyelo- caliceal dilatation. At physical examination, dysmorphic features were noted, such as hypertelorism, overriding sutures, hooked nose, micrognathia, camptodactyly of the fifth finger, single transverse palmar crease on the left hand and postaxial polydactyly on the right hand. Immediately after birth and during the following 17 days, she presented with hypoglycemic episodes difficult to control (glucose: 20–40 mg/dl). Laboratory exams, performed during one of these episodes, showed lactic acidemia (4.0 μmol/ml; N: 0.7–2.5 μmol/ml), mild hyperammonemia,– and marked metabolic acidosis (pH 7.20; pCO2 25.1 mmHg; HCO3- 9.6 mEq/L; BE -17.5 mEq/L). Neurologic exam, per- formed at 4 days of life, showed incomplete Moro reflex, posture of limbs flexion, reduced axial tonus, and slightly elevated appendicular tonus. At 6 days of life, antibiotics were administered for one week due to suspicion of sepsis. On the seventh and 25th days, two samples of urine and one of plasma were collected and sent for inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) screening. Amino acid analyses were carried out on a Biochrom 20 (Biochrom Ltd., Cambridge, UK) amino acid analyzer. Sample preparation and analysis were performed accord- ing to the manufacturer’s standard protocols. General aminoaciduria was observed and some plasma amino acids were also altered (Table 1). Urinary organic acid analyses by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC- MS) (according to Tanaka et al 1980) showed massive excretion of fumaric acid (> 232 mmol/ mol creatinine, normal range < 45 mmol/mol creatinine). The same result was presented by a new urine sample collected at 40 days of life.
At 1 month of age, despite breast feeding and normal sucking, the baby had extreme difficulty gaining weight, remaining undernourished due to persistent vomiting and occasional diarrhea. Cholestatic jaundice and hepatomegaly were noted since birth. At 40 days of life, the following hepatic enzymes were altered: [aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 137 U/L, N 10–34 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 78 U/L, N 5–35 U/L; alkaline leukocyte phosphatase (ALP) 267 U/L, N 20–140 U/L, and gamma- glutamyltranspeptidase (γ–GT) 505 U/L, N 0–51 U/L]. Further exams at this period revealed colpocephaly [cranial computed tomography (CT)], infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis [abdominal ultrasound (US)] and interatrial com- munication (ECO). At one-and-a-half months of age, pyloromyotomy was performed, but vomiting episodes persisted. At this time, she still presented with lactic acidemia (5.0 μmol/ml), metabolic acidosis, and mild hyperammonemia. Hemotransfusion was performed due to anemia. At 2 months and 4 days, hemoculture was positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis, and she was treated with antibiotics for 14 days. There was a small weight gain, but hepatic enzymes remained altered. At 3 months and 5 days, the girl was discharged but continued to gain weight slowly, although being fed with breast milk and supplementary formula. Vomiting episodes twice a day and occasional diarrhea persisted. At 4 months and 9 days, she was readmitted owing to vomiting with traces of blood, hyperpyrexia, intense crying and pallor, dyspnea, and
dehydration.","Farid Zare","FH","Yes","Fumarase deficiency"," 606812","24","PMID: 20549362",,,,
364,"The patient, a boy, the first child of consanguineous Moroccan parents, was referred to a secondary hospital at the age of 2 months because of failure to thrive and insufficient milk intake.
The pregnancy was uneventful and prenatal imaging was normal. Labor was induced at 42 weeks’ gestational age. His birth weight was 3.7 kg (+0.5 SD) and Apgar scores were 9 and 10 at 5 and 10 minutes, respectively.
He was breastfed from the beginning, but according to his parents, he started to drink less from the age of 1 month onwards. Moreover, he appeared to be increasingly uncomfortable. At presentation, a crying hypotonic infant without evident dysmorphic features was seen. Physical examination was normal, no hepatomegaly was found.
His weight was 5.4 kg (–0.3 SD), length 62.5 cm (–0.1 SD), and head circumference 38.5 cm (–2.1 SD). He was admitted to the hospital for tube feeding and extensive diagnostic workup, including laboratory tests, genetic analysis, and radiologic imaging. Because of the failure to thrive, reduced food intake, and hypotonia, an inborn metabolic disorder was suspected and urine and plasma metabolites were also analyzed.
Laboratory results, including complete blood count, electrolytes, blood gas analysis, and liver and kidney function tests were all within normal limits. Ultrasonography of the brain showed a moderate dilation of both lateral ventricles. Genetic testing ruled out Prader Willi syndrome, single-nucleotide polymorphism array only showed many regions of homozygosity, consistent with consanguinity.
Organic acid analyses of the patient’s urine by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry revealed repeatedly a severely elevated excretion of fumarate (313 and 317 nmol/mmol creatinine; normal <20), and increased excretion of succinate (85 and 221 nmol/mmol creatinine; normal < 50), and 2-ketoglutarate (238 and 217; nmol/mmol creatinine (normal <50), suggestive of FD. All other metabolic analyses performed showed no abnormalities.
At the age of 7 months, the patient was referred to a tertiary center for consultation of a pediatric neurologist, MRI, and genetic counseling to confirm the diagnosis of FD. At that time, he had severe axial hypotonia, with slipping through and persistent head lag, inadequate balance of head and trunk, convergence spasms, and a suspicion of cerebral visual impairment. Movements and reflexes were symmetrical, but the plantar foot sole reflex showed a Babinski triple response. Furthermore, he had developed a progressive microcephaly (head circumference 40.7 cm, –3.6 SD).
MRI showed delayed myelinization and decreased supra- as well as infratentorial white matter volume (possibly because of atrophy) and a hypoplastic corpus callosum (Figure 1).

365,"A 19-month-old male infant was referred to the Metabolic Clinic for developmental delay and encephalopathy. The infant was the sec- ond child of a gravida 2, para 2, 37 year old mother and a 34 year old father, born after an uneventful pregnancy. He was born term at 39 weeks of gestation via cesarean section due to fetal distress. The birth weight and length as well as the head circumference were in the normal range. There were no postnatal complications, or feeding difficulties.
The infant was the second child of his parents. He had a three-year-old sister who was in good health. There was no history of consanguinity or birth defects in the family. Examination of the father showed subcutane- ous leiomyomas on his arms. Renal ultrasounds of the parents were normal.
Despite good feeding his weight was below 3rd centile by 4 months of age. By 9 months, he was not sitting and was referred to a neurologist. The neurological examination revealed mild truncal hypotonia with normal muscle strength. The deep tendon reflexes were 2+ in all extremities. There was no ankle clonus and no abnor- mal movements. A karyotype and subtelomeric FISH studies were normal.
MRI of the brain at 24 months revealed hypomyelination of white matter and marked thinning of the corpus callosum (Fig. 1). The EEG was normal.
Slow progression in the development continued without any regres- sion. He could sit unsupported at 11 months, was able to pull to stand at 13 months and started crawling at 14 months. No babbling was noticed. At the age of 33 months he was able to pull up to stand, to grasp and put things on one another and started to make some words. The ophthalmo- logic examination did not show any other abnormality, aside from strabismus.
At age of 46 months he was able to walk some distance with assis- tance and showed slow progress in development and growth without seizures and deterioration in skills.
At the age of 6 years and three months he had no speech but only some signs and did not have any additional neurologic signs except episodes of shivers and loss of eye control lasting for 3–5 min.
At age of 7 years, the patient was still developmentally delayed and had short stature. He also had possible seizures with normal EEG and walked with an ataxic gait. He did not speak any words but was very social.
The blood lactate showed minimal elevation at 16.9 mg/dl. The py- ruvate was 0.96 mg/dl, within the normal range. Ammonia was normal at 13 μmol/l. Blood acylcarnitine and amino acid investigation with tan- dem mass spectrometry were in the normal range.

366,"A 27-year-old woman had persistent weakness in her upper and lower limbs for 10 years. The weakness of her upper and lower limbs did not affect her work and life. She was misdiagnosed with seronegative polymyositis for which she received 2.5 milligrams prednisone per day one year prior to admission. In the month prior to admission, she gradually became unable to take care of herself. She had no other previous medical history, nor had she traveled abroad. She was not pregnant. The patient’s parents were healthy as was her younger brother and son. There was no genetic disease in her family. Her physical examination was normal except for weakness of the upper and lower limbs.
Following admission, she developed repeated episodes of hypoglycemia, hyper lactic acidemia, and hyperlipidemia (Table 1). On the fifth day, she was transferred to critical care unit due to respiratory failure, anuria, and liver failure. Both lungs showed large patchy lesions, and the density of the liver was quantitatively measured by CT image as -40 Hu, which was lower than the density of water (0 Hu) and was similar to the density of fat (-40 Hu). Since the patient showed persistent fever, next-generation sequencing for infectious pathogens and culture of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were performed to rule out infectious pathogens such as Cytomegalovirus, Herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus and Pneumocystis in the respiratory tract. The method of mNGS was the same as discribed before (6).
As the patient had hypoglycemia, diagnosis of glycogen storage disease was considered. Due to the patient’s persistently abnormal coagulation parameters, a liver biopsy was not performed. A muscle biopsy did not demonstrate obvious lipid deposits, but magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lower limbs revealed a large amount of fat accumulation between the muscles. The patient remained aurinc due to renal failure, so the urine organic acids were not performed. Results of whole exome sequencing revealed a homozygous mutation of ETFDH gene (c.250G>A) as shown in Figure 1B. The patient was diagnosed with glutaric aciduria type IIC and was treated with 150mg riboflavin per day and 40mg coenzyme Q10 per day. The patient was alos given a high-sugar and low-fat diet. CT imaging suggested that the patient’s liver was improved significantly which was confirmed by laboratory tests.

367,"A four-and-a-half-month-old, vaccinated male
presented with complaints of fever and fits for the last
15 days and an altered level of consciousness for seven
days. The patient developed a fever, which was acute
in onset, intermittent, 101 F and was not relieved by
oral antipyretics. The fever was associated with
generalized fits involving both the upper and lower
limbs. Fits lasted for around two to three minutes, with
eyes rolling back, frothing saliva, and faecal
incontinence. His parents rushed him to a nearby
hospital, where doctors performed a Lumbar Puncture
(LP) and initial care. Lumbar Puncture was
unremarkable, and they admitted the patient for around 20 days. During his stay in the hospital, the
patient aspirated while he was being fed, suffered
severe respiratory distress and lost consciousness.
Their parents brought him to a tertiary care hospital in
Karachi, where the patient was intubated and kept on
ventilator support. Due to financial constraints, they
left against medical advice on the same day.
Consequently, the parents brought the child to the
National Institute of Child Health (NICH) Karachi,
Pakistan, a tertiary care public hospital.
is past medical history and birth history was
unremarkable. He was BCG vaccinated, had been
breastfed exclusively since birth, and had been
developmentally appropriate for his age. He was the
first child of consanguineously married parents of
Sindhi origin. Two maternal cousins passed away due
to the same disease at the ages of ten months and three
years. The presenting complaints in both cases were
fits.
On arrival, the patient was an intubated male
infant who landed in the emergency with a blood
pressure of 93/51 mmHg, heart rate of 110 bpm,
respiratory rate of 30 breaths/min, maintaining the
saturation of oxygen 98%. His weight was five kg (less
than the third centile), length was 58 cm (less than the
third centile), and frontal-occipital circumference was
38 cm (less than the third centile). His CNS
examination revealed increased tone in all four limbs,
reflexes brisk in lower limbs, and planters bilaterally
upgoing. GCS was 5T and pupils BERL. Anterior
fontanel was full and open 1.5x1.5 cm. The rest of the
examination was unremarkable.
Lab results showed elevated ALP levels,
plasma lactic acids levels and plasma ammonia levels.
His ABGs showed severe metabolic acidosis indicated
by a pH of 6.94, decreased pCo2, elevated pO2,
decreased HCO3 and an elevated anion gap. His blood
glucose, serum calcium levels, ALT levels and SaO2
levels were within normal ranges. Complete blood
count and renal function tests were unremarkable.
A CT scan brain without contrast (Figure 1–
3) showed prominent extra-axial subarachnoid spaces.
It was suggestive of benign enlargement of
subarachnoid spaces of infancy (BESSI), in bilateral
frontal and temporal regions, with usual grey and
white matter differentiation.
Plasma amino acids testing conducted by
Cation-Exchange HPLC (Biochrom 30+)
Showed decreased serine, asparagine, glutamine,
alanine, citrulline, cysteine, methionine, ornithine,
histidine, and arginine. Urine for organic acids showed
marked excretion of 3-methyl-crotonyl glycine, three
hydroxy isovaleric acids, 3-hydroxybutyric acid, and
moderate excretion of lactic acid. The report was
suggestive of a double peak of acetoacetic acid, a
moderate rise of 2-hydroxybutyric acid, and a small
peak of 3 hydroxy valeric acids. The profile was typical of 3-methylcrotonylglycinuria due to a
deficiency of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase.
The patient was intubated in the paediatric
ICU and kept on ventilator support. We added IV
antibiotics, and sodium bicarbonate bolus to correct
severe metabolic acidosis and ensured neuroprotective
measures according to the guidelines for the
management of severe traumatic brain injury. Later,
composition fluid (90 ml 10% DW/10ml of sodium
bicarbonate) with 1.5 times maintenance was given.
We successfully extubated the patient after seven
days. Workup was found suggestive of 3-MCC
deficiency; hence, we took a metabolic disease
consultant on board, and she started syrup, L-carnitine
and biotin supplements. After that, dried blood spot
biotinidase levels were checked, which were found to

369,"A 60-year-old male patient had a chief complaint of progressive nyctalopia. He had undergone cataract surgery in both eyes. The patient had undergone hand surgery due to chronic pain in both hands. The patient underwent a comprehensive ophthalmic evaluation by at least one of the authors (NIE). The best Corrected Visual acuity was 0.18 and 1.3 (log Mar) in the right and left eye, respectively. Refraction was +0.75 +0.50 x 10˚ and +0.75 +0.72 x 25˚ in the right and left eye, respectively. The patient had pseudophakia in both eyes. Upon fundus examination, the patient had pale optic nerves, arteriolar attenuation, paravenous retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) hyperplasia, a “salt-and-pepper” appearance surrounding the macula, and mid-peripheral bony spicules.

Upon macular optical coherence tomography (OCT) (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc., Dublin, CA, USA), the patient had a macular thickness of 254 and 188 micrometers in the right (OD) and left eye (OS), respectively.

370,"A 51-year-old male from Barbados was referred to the Ocular Genetics clinic in April 2018 with a clinical diagnosis of retinitis pigmentosa that had been made 10 years prior. He described a long-standing history of nyctalopia that began when he was 9 to10 years old that was accompanied by reduced peripheral vision. He felt that his visual symptoms had been slowly worsening over time. A review of symptoms was positive for hearing loss that had started 4 years ago and seemed to be gradually progressing. In addition, he had chronic dry skin and a recent onset of intermittent paresthesias of the upper and lower extremities. He denied difficulties with balance or loss of smell.

His past medical history was significant for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and erectile dysfunction. His current medications included candesartan, amlodipine, rosuvastatin, low-dose aspirin, and metformin. He had no history of smoking and he had no known medication allergies. There was no significant family history of ocular disease or of symptoms that could be suggestive of Refsum disease.

When examined, his spectacle-corrected Snellen visual acuity was 20/80 + 2 OD and 20/50 + 2 OS, not improving with pinhole correction. His refractive error was −2.75 + 2.00 × 135 OD and − 1.50 + 1.25 × 043 OS with a +2.50 reading add OU. His pupils were equal and reactive to light and accommodation with no relative afferent pupillary defect. A slit-lamp examination of the anterior segment revealed mild posterior subcapsular lens changes OD and the presence of anterior vitreous cells OU. Posterior segment examination demonstrated a significant retinopathy OU with diffuse retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) degeneration, mid-peripheral pigment clumps, and retinal arteriolar narrowing (Figure 1). The optic discs appeared grossly normal without any significant signs of pallor. There were no appreciable signs of diabetic retinopathy.Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed extensive outer retinal degeneration with attenuation of the outer nuclear layer, ellipsoid zone, and RPE. Scattered outer retinal tubulations were present along with bilateral epiretinal membranes (Figure 2). Blue-peak fundus autofluorescence demonstrated small regions of foveal increased autofluorescence demarcated by scalloped borders. The remainder of the retina had decreased autofluorescence, in keeping with extensive RPE degeneration. An octopus visual field test confirmed significant peripheral field constriction with approximately 30° of residual field in either eye when interrogated with the V4e target.A full field electroretinogram (ffERG) had been performed in 2015 using DTL electrodes with the International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV) standard parameters. The rod-driven responses and cone-driven bright flash were extinguished. The 30 Hz flicker response was severely diminished with an amplitude of 2.2 μV (normal 68-118 μV) and implicit time of 37.5 ms (normal 25-29.8 ms) OD and an amplitude of 2.1 μV (normal 68-118 μV) and implicit time of 47.0 ms (normal 25-29.8 ms) OS (Figure 3).","Marina Wasef","PHYH","Yes","Phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase deficiency","266500","773","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmd2.12147",,,,
371,"A 63-year-old Albanian male patient was referred to our clinic for cataract surgery evaluation. He presented with a complaint of decreased vision, predominantly in his left eye. His ocular history was apparently unremarkable. Upon medical history, he reported hypertension, recurrent syncope and left bundle branch block in left ventricular hypertrophy treated with pacemaker implantation about 10 years before, chronic kidney disease, and adult-onset sporadic episodes of paresthesia in the feet. He had family history of kidney transplantation (brother) and cardiac pathology (maternal uncle). Of note, the patient never took medication that could cause corneal deposits (such as amiodarone, chloroquine, indomethacin, and phenothiazines). A detailed ophthalmologic examination was performed. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/40 in the left eye and 20/20 in the right eye. Slit-lamp exam detected yellowbrownish powdery deposits arranged in a whorl pattern in the inferior cornea in both eyes (Figure 1(a)), vascular tortuosity and telangiectasias in conjunctival vessels (Figure 1(c) and (d)), and posterior subcapsular lens opacities by retro-illumination (this latter being more advanced in the left eye). Dilated fundus examination showed marked tortuosity of retinal vessels (Figure 1(b)). With a suspicion of FD, IVCM was performed using a digital corneal confocal laser-scanning microscope (HRT-II/3 Rostock Cornea
Module, Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, Heidelberg,
Germany) to evaluate central and peripheral corneal tissue
as well as the sub-basal nerve plexus (CSNP). The sequence
of scans revealed the presence of intracellular hyper-reflective deposits in the superficial to the basal cells layer of the
corneal epithelium (Figure 2(a) and (c)), ranging from the
limbus to the central cornea. Three high-quality nerve
plexus images containing the highest, intermediate and
least number of nerve fibers were selected from each eye,
and the average of the following parameters was considered: number of fibers, defined as the total number of principal nerve trunks and their branches per image; nerve fiber
density (NFD, fibers/mm2
) and length (NFL, mm/mm2
),
calculated using the semi-automated tracing program
NeuronJ (Rasband W, National Institute of Health, USA)8
;
nerve fiber tortuosity, determined by using the OliveiraSoto and Efron score system (range, 0–4).9
 The number of
fibers per image was 9.0 in the right eye and 9.3 in the left
eye; NFD was 31.3 fibers/mm2
 in the right eye and 37.5fibers/mm2
 in the left eye; NFL was 17.7mm/mm2
 in the right
eye and 18.1mm/mm2
 in the left eye; nerve tortuosity was
graded as 1 and 2 in the right and left eye, respectively

372,"Patient 1 was a female neonate, born after 37 weeks of gestation to a primigravida mother. The patient was normally delivered, without hypoxia (Apgar score 10-10) and with no visible dysplasias. The birth weight was 3252 g, with a height of 51 cm and a head circumference of 34 cm. There was no conflict between blood types and Rh factors; there was no history of heritable diseases in the family. During the first day after birth, the newborn started to be fed her mother’s breast milk. However, on the second day of life, signs of jaundice and lethargy began to appear, the newborn was then transferred from a small town hospital to LUHS Kaunas Clinics. There was an increase in the patient’s blood levels of total bilirubin (from 281 to 402.88 µmol/L) and conjugated bilirubin (from 33.84 to 44.59 µmol/L); glycemia (4.3 mmol/L) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (1.33 mg/L) were within normal range. The patient was treated with phototherapy, however, jaundice became more prominent with time. On the seventh day of life, the patient’s skin became strongly bronze-colored, signs of gastrointestinal bleeding began to appear, in conjunction with hepatomegaly and acute liver failure. Blood clotting was severely compromised (Owren’s Stago Prothrombin Assay (SPA) = 5%, international normalized ratio (INR) = 8.2), concentrations of both total and conjugated bilirubin remained high (394.47 µmol/L and 41.63 µmol/L respectively), while liver enzymes were within normal range. (In Lithuania and Scandinavia, Owren’s SPA is more commonly used than prothrombin time.) The patient was gradually losing weight, over 7 days she had lost ~15% of her body weight at the time of birth, even though at the time she was being regularly given her mother’s breast milk via a nasogastric (NG) tube. Over the period of the next two days, the patient’s condition continued to deteriorate, excessive bleeding from puncture sites was observed, together with signs of progressing liver failure. The patient still retained a strong bronze color of the skin, and signs of lethargy were still being observed. A metabolic disease was suspected; the enteral feeding of breast milk was discontinued and the patient was started on parenteral nutrition. At that time, the biochemical blood profile showed decreasing levels of total protein (from 50.01 to 32.10 mg/L) and albumin (from 23 to 18 mg/L), clotting parameters remained abnormal (Owren’s SPA = 5%, INR = 8.2), CRP was not substantially elevated (35.4 mg/L), complete blood count indicated leukopenia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. However, the biochemical blood profile also revealed slightly decreasing concentrations of ammonia (from 100 to 68 µmol/L) and total bilirubin (from 265.46 to 185.96 µmol/L), while showing slightly increasing levels of conjugated bilirubin (from 45.73 to 57.33 µmol/L). The patient was diagnosed with sepsis (blood cultures grew E. coli, sensitive to cefuroxime and gentamicin), and antibacterial treatment was started. With continuing antibacterial and symptom-alleviating treatment, as well as the discontinuation of breast milk, the patient’s condition was stabilized.

373,"Patient 2 was a female neonate, born after 40 weeks of gestation to a primigravida mother. The patient was normally delivered, without hypoxia (Apgar score 10-10) and with no visible dysplasias. Body mass at birth was 3400 g, 52 cm in height, with a head circumference of 36 cm. It is known from family history that the biological mother had a mental illness, and the father was suffering from diabetes and chronic alcoholism. There was no conflict between blood types and Rh factors. The patient was being fed her mother’s breast milk by bottle. Even though the newborn was eagerly consuming breast milk, she lost 12% of her body weight over a 2-day period. On the third day of life, symptoms of jaundice and lethargy began to appear—the patient was transferred from a small town hospital to the LUHS Kaunas Clinics hospital for all further treatment. From the biochemical blood profile (performed at the LUHS hospital), an elevated concentration of total bilirubin was observed (304 µmol/L), with unconjugated bilirubin being the dominant form (16 µmol/L of conjugated bilirubin). Over the following 4 days, while applying phototherapy, jaundice was becoming more prominent, the patient developed hepatomegaly, body weight continued to decline (the patient lost 16% of her body weight at birth in total). After that period of 4 days, even larger concentrations of total bilirubin (509.7 µmol/L) and conjugated bilirubin (50 µmol/L) were measured in the patient’s blood. The patient had increased levels of liver enzymes (aspartate transaminase (AST)—128 IU/L, alanine transaminase (ALT)—150 IU/L), while gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) remained within normal range. Blood clotting factors (Owren’s SPA = 70%), albumin (29 g/L), total blood protein (45 g/L), glycemia (3.97 mmol/L) and CRP (5 mg/L) remained within normal range.

However, he continued to vomit in spite of the change to formula feeding. He was admitted to the hospital 1 week after birth with high bilirubin level and jaundice. The patient's condition improved in almost 1 week and was discharged with formula feeding. A short time after the discharge, he was admitted to the hospital again with complaints of abdominal swelling. A liver biopsy was performed and thereafter he was followed-up with the diagnosis of “cirrhosis.” He was admitted to the hospital frequently due to fever, pneumonia, and diarrhea and finally had a diagnosis of galactosemia with the identification of galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase deficiency in the serum and urine at the age of 8 months. Diet regulations were made. The first cranial magnetic resonance imaging of the patient was unremarkable at that time. The patient, whose motor development was delayed, held his head up at the age of 3 years, started sitting up, and later crawling and speaking at the age of 4 years. Sphincter control started at the age of 5 years. He had a febrile convulsion when he was 3 months old. The mother and father were cousins, and three siblings of the patient were healthy.

382,"A seven-day-old female neonate born at 38 gestational weeks, after an uncomplicated pregnancy, was admitted due to poor feeding, vomiting, weight loss, and jaundice. There was no parental consanguinity or family history of an inherited disorder. At birth, the baby’s body weight (3,110 g), length (49 cm), and head circumference (34 cm) were normal (25th-50th percentile). Apgar score was 9 and 10 in the first and fifth minutes, respectively.

384,"A six-year-old boy was pre-diagnosed with galactosemia during infancy when he developed vomiting, poor feeding, jaundice, liver dysfunction and failure to thrive. Serum total bilirubin (8.7 mg/dl, reference range 0.3–1 mg/dl) was elevated. Plasma aspartate transaminase (89 U/L, reference range <20 U/L), alanine transaminase (94 U/L, reference range <20 U/L), and alkaline phosphatase (400 U/L, reference range 30–85 U/L) were significantly elevated. Liver biopsy was performed and revealed degeneration of hepatocyte with giant cell transformation and moderate cholestasis of both hepatocellular and canalicular with bile thrombi associated with minimal necro-inflammatory changes of hepatocyte. Galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT) (1.7 U/g, reference range >3 U/g) was deficient. During infancy, he was managed by removing all galactose from the diet as soon as the diagnosis was suspected, immediately after starting the diagnostic investigations and without awaiting results, in order to prevent further life-threatening complications. There was family history of galactosemia of third-degree relative (cousin). The young patient presented for examination because of joints pain and deformities. On examination, he was of short stature with poor dentition (Figure 1). Hands examination revealed dark skin pigmentation over the small joints of the hands, widening of the fingers most obvious in the ring and little fingers of both hands, and limitation of range of motion of the fingers (Figure 2). The dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan revealed osteopenia (Z score −2.2).

385,"Here, we report a female newborn with severe indirect-hyperbilirubinemia who was eventually diagnosed as having classic galactosemia. She was born at 38 gestational weeks to a 34-year-old mother with an unremarkable prenatal history. The baby was delivered by cesarean section with normal Apgar score, 2920 g birthweight, and normal growth parameters/examinations except for right-hand polydactyly. Her parents were healthy first-cousin adults with O+ blood-group. The father had a neonatal history of jaundice and blood-exchange-transfusion. Her sibling was a normal 4-year-old female, who also had a history of neonatal jaundice that recovered with home phototherapy. The parents denied having any liver/hemolytic or other disorders in the family. She was discharged after 36-hr in a good condition without icterus from the nursery. She was first icteric on the 4th day with total (T) bilirubin (Bil): 18 mg/dL and direct (D) Bil: 0.6 mg/dL. The parents chose home phototherapy although they were advised for hospital admission. They rechecked bilirubin on the 7th day of life because they felt the jaundice was getting worse. The mother mentioned some poor feeding in her baby. She was hospitalized with TBil: 34 mg/dL and DBil: 2.7 mg/dL, so intensive phototherapy, sepsis tests, and antibiotic therapy were performed. She was prepared for exchange transfusion. The infant responded very well to intensive phototherapy; therefore, the exchange transfusion was withheld. The mother was satisfied with her breastfeeding soon after. Six-hours of intensive phototherapy resulted in TBil: 22 mg/dL and DBil: 1.2 mg/dL. The baby had bronze skin and dark urine, but her stool had a greenish color. Blood/urine cultures were negative, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) as 91 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST): 100 IU/L, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH): 1.8 mIU/L. Abdominal ultrasonography was normal, showing normal sized liver/spleen. Cardiac consultation and echocardiography showed normal results. The infant’s yellowish and bronze-skin color improved significantly, with normalization of urine color. Stool color was still normal. T/Dbilirubin and hemoglobin levels gradually decreased. She was discharged after 7 days of antibiotic-therapy and advised to be followed as an outpatient with ALT: 61 IU/L, AST: 69 IU/L, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT): 25 IU/L, TBil: 9.2 mg/dl, DBil: 1.2 md/dl, Hb: 10.3 mg/dL. The baby still looked icteric and mildly bronzed a week later; she had an acceptable weight gain while on breastfeeding with normal urine/stool color, and neither hepatosplenomegaly nor abdominal distension. At the second outpatient visit, laboratory values were TBil: 5.2 mg/dl and DBil: 2.4 mg/dl, Hb: 9.7 mg/dL, WBC: 7600/mm3, Glu: 169 mg/dl, retic: 0.4%, ALT: 61IU/L, AST: 69 IU/L, and she was still icteric and producing greasy stool. Metabolic screen tests were ordered. A week later, abdominal distension with dark urine and acholic stool developed. She was readmitted. Her feeding was good and she was lively. Hepatosplenomegaly could not be detected because of severe ascites, but abdominal ultrasonography revealed enlarged liver/spleen with a large amount of fluid in the abdominal cavity. Blood tests revealed the following: WBC: 6500/mm3, Plt: 266,000/mm3, Hb: 8.7 mg/dL, mean corpuscular volume (MCV): 110 fl, and retic: 16.7%. A blood-smear showed a large amount of acanthocytes (spur cells). Glu: 169 mg/dl, TBil: 6.3 mg/dl, DBil: 4 mg/dl, ALT: 84 IU/L, AST: 304 IU/L, albumin (Alb): 2.8 mg/dl, ESR: 6 mm/hr, CRP: 5 mg/L, prothrombin time (PT): 21 sec, partial thromboplastin time (PTT): 65 sec, Na: 134 mmol/L, K: 5 mmol/L, ferritin: 2827 ng/ml. Ascitic fluid had Glu: 95 mg/dl, protein: 0.8 mg/dl, WBC: 0–1 mm3, and RBC: 3200 mm3 and a negative culture. Urinalysis showed 12–15 leukocytes unit. Broad-spectrum antibiotics, vitamin K, packed-cell, and albumin were administrated. In this hospital admission, the mother informed us that three of the paternal second cousins had icterus and abdominal distension requiring exchange-transfusion and one with kernicterus; one of which is still alive. She added no more information. As the patients’ records were reviewed, we noticed that their living relative had known galactosemia. The infant’s soy-based formula was substituted thereafter.

All fluid cultures were negative except for urine culture which revealed Klebsiella (25,000 colony count). The infant’s condition, icterus, and abdominal distention gradually improved. Urine sugar chromatography then also showed a dense galactose band. All tests significantly improved after the lactose-free formula substitution. The baby did well and had normal growth and feeding without icterus in subsequent follow-up visits.","Marina Wasef","GALT","No","Galactosemia, classical","230400","79239","https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7536454/",,,,

394,"Case Description:
This case involves three siblings, two girls and one boy, born to consanguineous parents of Middle Eastern descent. The family history was significant for early-onset liver disease in the children. 
The older sister presented at four months of age with hepatosplenomegaly, abdominal bloating, and vomiting. A liver biopsy revealed fibrosis with increased glycogen storage. She remained clinically stable for several years but at 13 years of age presented with cachexia, abdominal pain, and a rapidly enlarging liver mass. Imaging confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with vascular invasion. Despite referral for specialized care, she succumbed to the disease before treatment could be initiated.

The younger sister, who became the proband, presented in infancy with hepatosplenomegaly and mild gastrointestinal symptoms. She showed no significant health issues until 13 years of age, when a routine check revealed a large focal liver lesion during imaging. Laboratory tests revealed significantly elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels (>40,000 ng/mL), but no abnormalities in urine or plasma amino acid profiles, including succinylacetone.  She underwent liver transplantation for curative treatment of HCC. Post-operative recovery was uneventful, and her liver function normalized.

The younger brother exhibited hepatosplenomegaly during infancy but was monitored closely due to the family history. By the age of 11 years, he developed liver stiffness consistent with stage 2–3 fibrosis, but imaging showed no signs of HCC.

403,"A 12-day-old male neonate was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) with poor feeding, lethargy, and respiratory distress. His mother reported that he had become increasingly weak over the past 24 hours, refusing to nurse. There was no history of fever or recent illness. The pregnancy was uneventful, and he was born at full term via spontaneous vaginal delivery with a normal birth weight. However, a previous sibling died in the neonatal period 
On initial assessment, the neonate appeared severely lethargic and hypotonic, with tachypnea and poor suck reflex. He had Kussmaul breathing, and his capillary refill time was prolonged. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed profound metabolic acidosis (pH 7.12, bicarbonate 8 mmol/L, high anion gap 25 mmol/L). He had severe hyperammonemia (320 μmol/L, normal <50 μmol/L). Urinalysis showed marked ketonuria (3+ ketones, 300 mg/dL).

Due to the combination of metabolic acidosis, hyperammonemia, and ketonuria, a suspected inborn error of metabolism was considered. 
Plasma acylcarnitine profile and urine organic acid analysis revealed markedly elevated isovalerylglycine and C5-carnitine

At one month of age, he began developing progressive renal dysfunction, which led to recurrent hospital visits. Laboratory tests revealed marked hyperuricemia (uric acid levels between 1,192–1,535 μmol/L), metabolic acidosis, and respiratory alkalosis, raising concerns for an underlying metabolic disorder.

Neurologically, the infant displayed hypotonia, poor head control, and developmental delay, with abnormal limb posturing and occasional dystonic movements. Brain MRI findings showed diffuse white matter changes in the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, suggestive of metabolic encephalopathy. Renal ultrasound demonstrated bilateral nephromegaly with increased echogenicity, consistent with progressive renal damage due to uric acid crystallization.

Despite these challenges, he maintained normal social interactions and attended mainstream education.

At 14 years of age, he was referred for evaluation of elevated liver transaminases detected during a routine checkup for obesity. He had marked gynecomastia, a BMI of 29.0 kg/m², and evidence of hepatic steatosis on ultrasound. Initial biochemical investigations suggested metabolic syndrome.

415,"This infant was referred at the age of 46 days
for investigation of hypercalcaemia and hypotonia. He was born at term by spontaneous
vertex delivery and weighed 3.54 kg. Within 24
hours of delivery, he developed clinical and
radiological evidence of pneumonia requiring
treatment with intravenous antibiotics for
seven days. When 32 days old he was
re-admitted with a history of pyrexia and
reluctance to feed. Full blood count revealed a
neutrophil leucocytosis and empirical antibiotic therapy was commenced; however,
venous blood cultures demonstrated no growth
and chest x ray showed no abnormality.
Initial plasma investigations are shown in
table 1. Urinary phosphoethanolamine was
notably increased at 109 ,umol/mmol creatinine
(normal range 2-25 ,umol/mmol) and calcium/creatinine ratio was 3.27 mmol/mmol (normal
range < 0.7 mmol/mmol).
Initial management involved correction of
the hypercalcaemia with increased fluid intake
(200 ml/kg), diuretic therapy, and low calcium
milk formula. The plasma calcium fell to
normal within 10 days of admission.
Radiological skeletal survey carried out
shortly after admission demonstrated widened
cranial sutures and demineralisation of the
metaphyseal regions of the long bones most
noticeable in the proximal and distal femora.
There was poor ossification of the epiphysis of
the distal femora and the proximal tibia with a
normal thoracic cage. Renal ultrasound scan
revealed evidence of nephrocalcinosis.
An initial iliac crest bone biopsy specimen
taken at the age of seven months showed a
dimorphic picture (fig 1). Most of the specimen consisted of calcified woven bone with
active osteoclastic resorption. There was also
an area formed by an anastomosing network of
osteoid which was almost devoid of matrix.Subsequent clinical and developmental
progress was satisfactory, but the patient demonstrated early loss of primary dentition and
required multiple extractions of carious deciduous teeth. Serial plasma alkaline phosphatase activities remained below 23 IU/l but
serial plasma calcium concentrations and
urinary calcium/creatinine ratios remained
normal.
Serial radiological assessment demonstrated
improved skeletal mineralisation, but skull x
ray showed a slow progressive pansynostosis.
Cranial computed tomography scan demonstrated a mild degree of ventricular enlargement, and the patient currently remains under
neurosurgical review.
A further iliac crest bone biopsy was
performed at the age of two years. This showed
a noticeable improvement with no significant
mineralisation defect (fig 2). The trabeculae
were of lamellar bone and there was mild
osteopenia. Active bone turnover was evident
but this was not excessive and osteoid seams
were of normal thickness.Plasma alkaline phosphatase activities were
measured in several family members. Thematernal activity was 42 IU/1, and the maternal
grandmother's activity was 37 IU/I (normal

420,"The patient is a 16-year-old girl who presented with learning dis
abilities and seizures.
The pregnancy was normal, and the patient was delivered by un
complicated caesarean section at 39 + 0 weeks after induction of labor
was not successful. The patient had normal anthropometrics (birth
weight 3750 g, birth length 51 cm) and the neonatal period was normal.
Development of fine and gross motor skills and speech was normal. The
patient’s enrollment in school was postponed a year due to shyness and
delayed cognitive maturation. At age 6, the patient started primary
school on ordinary terms; however, the patient had a learning disability that was evident from the age of 7 years. When the patient was 11 years
old, she was granted extra support in school, and at age 14 she trans
ferred to a special needs school, which was a real improvement for her.
Neuropsychological testing at age 13 showed an intellectual quotient of
68 on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (Fifth Edition) [19]
equivalent to mild ID. The patient presented with decreased registration
of sensory inputs and difficulties in processing tactile stimuli during
sensory testing. After a psychiatric evaluation, the patient was diag
nosed with infantile autism. 
At age 1 year, the patient had three episodes with crying, aggressive
behavior, and change in breathing pattern after which she became
shortly unconscious. At this point, the patient’s EEG (48 h) was normal,
and the episodes were interpreted as breath holding spells treated with
iron supplementation. No further investigations were done at this point.
From age 9, the patient had incidents with nocturnal incontinence and
muscle pains, which could be indicators for nocturnal seizures. The
patient had her first bilateral tonic-clonic seizure (GTC) at age 10 years.
In the months leading up to the first GTC, the family noticed episodes
with decreased awareness and staring lasting only seconds. MR cere
brum at age 10 years showed a small frontolateral bleeding, suspected
due to head trauma sustained during the GTC, but otherwise normal
findings, and EEG was normal. After her second GTC, the patient started
Lamotrigine treatment at 5 mg/kg/day (175 mg) and was seizure free on
this dose for 13 months. Hereafter, the seizures recurred, and Lamo
trigine dose was increased gradually to 10 mg/kg/day (400 mg), which
decreased the number of GTC and absence like seizures. 48 h EEG was
repeated twice, the first with normal results and the second with indications of focal epilepsy, but no certain abnormal findings. Leve
tiracetam was initiated and gradually increased to 2000 mg/day.
Hereafter, no GTC was observed, but the total number of seizures
increased to 15 daily episodes with absence like seizures, speaking
nonsense, eye deviation, swaying, loud chewing, and no recollection of
the episode. Lamotrigine and Levetiracetam was discontinued and
substituted with first Brivaracetam (200 mg/day) and subsequently
additional Eslicarbazepine (800 mg/day). 
Physical examination including neurological examination was
without any positive findings, and she did not have any dysmorphic
features or visual or hearing impairment. The patient had a normal

and occupational therapy at 2 years of age. Seizures began at about 14
months of age during a febrile illness and occurred again at 15 months of
age when he experienced 12 seizures in 24 h. Sequencing and deletion/
duplication analysis of the SCN1 A gene encoding for the alpha-subunit
of the sodium voltage-gated channel returned normal results. He was
started on levetiracetam that controlled the seizures. At 3 years of age,
brain MRI was completely normal, but brain MRS demonstrated a
markedly diminished creatine peak, which was about 20 % of normal
(Fig. 1A and B) at which point he was referred to genetics. There was no
family history of seizures, developmental delay, learning disabilities or
other neurological disorders, although most relatives on the maternal
side were females. On exam, he had reduced muscle tone and was on the
lower percentiles for weight. He was not verbal.

438,"In 2006, a 52-year old female patient was admitted to a neurological department due to sudden difficulties with swallowing and speech, ophthalmoparesis with a vertical and horizontal eye movement disorder, dysesthesia of the hands with a quality of “pins and needles” and a glove-like distribution, as well as generalized areflexia. Muscle strength was normal. A Miller Fisher syndrome was diagnosed. Under treatment with 150 g intravenous immunoglobulins the symptoms completely remitted within a few days. In the following years, the patient consulted the general practitioner and several gastroenterologists because of unspecific abdominal pain, from which she has been suffering since childhood. Diagnostics including computer tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and gastroscopy were normal.

In October 2017 the meanwhile 63-year old patient was hospitalized with generalized epileptic seizures with prolonged postictal confusion. Cerebral MRI showed no pathological findings, and therapy with levetiracetam was started.

In December 2017 the patient was admitted to our clinic for internal medicine because of persisting diarrhea, abdominal pain, renal failure and a reduced general state of health. Again, the patient had generalized epileptic seizures with postictal confusion and significantly reduced vigilance, accompanied from a lactic acidosis (serum-lactate 26.0 mmol/l (reference 0.55–2.2 mmol/l), pH 6.863), leading to admission to the neurological intensive care unit. Moreover, a slight, presumably residual ophthalmoparesis as vertical gaze palsy with conjugate, bilateral limitation of the eye movements in upgaze was evident. The anticonvulsive therapy with levetiracetam (3 g/day) was extended by lacosamide (400 mg/day). A mechanical ventilation was necessary due to the sudden and massive metabolic acidosis as well as a respiratory failure during an epileptic seizure (serum-lactat 14.7; 10.6; 16.0 mmol/l). In CSF, lactate (12.01 mmol/l (reference 1.12–2.47 mmol/l) and protein level (67 mg/dl (reference 15–45 mg/dl) were significantly increased. There were no signs for an infectious origin in CSF (polymerase chain reaction for neurotrophic germs, including Tropheryma whippelii). CT and MRI of the brain as well as abdominal- and thorax-CT were normal. The electroneurography revealed a slight mixed axonal-demyelinating polyneuropathy, the electromyography was normal. Besides a sinus-tachycardia with 140 bpm and a mild pericardial effusion, no signs of a Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome, that would be common in mitochondriopathies, were present.

Attempted extubation failed as another severe epileptic seizure occurred with life-threatening lactic acidosis and hyperkalemia (lactate 26.0 mmol/l; pH 6.925; potassium 7.8 mmol/l (referece 3.6–5.2 mmol/l). EEG showed an alpha rhythm, with intermittent slow waves and tendency to generalize. In cerebral follow-up MRI, multiple fat embolies were detected. CT-angiography of the lung revealed a pulmonary embolism. As a reason for the fat embolies, multiple vertebral fractures were verified in CT, presumably as a result of severe epileptic seizures. A surgical fixation of vertebral fractures was performed. Finally, the analysis of the amino acids in the urine, CSF and serum showed a strong abnormality with ubiquitously increased amino acids, especially proline (proline in serum 3085 μmol/l (reference 90-342 μmol/l), in urine 46,531 μmol/g Crea (reference < 100 μmol/g Crea), in CSF 104 mg/dl (reference < 6 mg/dl), Hydroxyproline in urine 1395 μmol/g Crea (reference <100) Table 1).

439,"This boy of European ancestry was the 3.00 kg, 53 cm product of a pregnancy that was complicated by consanguinity. He was born at term by spontaneous vaginal delivery and did well after birth.

He first came to medical attention at 12 months of age because of developmental delay. He rolled at 7 months, commando crawled at 8 months and sat alone at 10 months. He was otherwise healthy except for mild conductive hearing loss secondary to recurrent otitis media.

He was noted to have relative microcephaly and mildly dysmorphic facial features (bulbous nose with hypoplastic nasae alae and long philtrum), along with bilateral obstructed nasolacrimal ducts. Chromosome analysis revealed a 46,XY,var(8)(p23.1p23.2) karyotype with a familial, clinically insignificant euchromatic variant (Tsai et al. 2002; Barber et al. 2005). Plasma amino acid profile was normal. Urine organic acid profile was significant for a peak level of 3-hydroxyisobutyric acid of approximately 7000 mmol/mol creatinine (normal < 100 mmol/mol creatinine) and mildly increased concentrations of 3-hydroxypropionic and 2-ethyl-3-hydroxypropionic acids.

440,"A female child was born by normal vaginal delivery at
38 weeks gestation following an uneventful pregnancy
to consanguineous parents from Pakistan. Birth weight
was 2.26 kg (0.4th/2nd percentile) with a relatively
conserved head circumference of 31.5 cm (9th percentile). At birth, the child was noted to have bilateral
microphthalmia with cataracts and hypotonia. Facial
features included narrowed, downslanting palpebral
®ssures and a short convex nose with depressed nasal
bridge (Figure 1). There was some limitation of
abduction of the hips with no subluxation on ultrasound. In addition the thumbs were adducted. The child
was very slow to feed with a poor suck re¯ex.
Investigations for congenital infection were normal.
Initial plasma amino-acid pro®le, lactate and ammonia
levels were also normal although a subsequent serum
lactate value was marginally elevated at 2.51 mmol lÿ1
(normal range 0.63±2.44 mmol lÿ1). There were no
reducing substances in the urine. Associated with a
mild urinary lactic acidosis, urinary organic acid analysis revealed excess 3-hydroxyisobutyric acid at a level
of 1650 ìmmolÿ1 creatinine (normal level , 40) with
some elevation of 3-hydroxyproprionate and methyl
citrate. Although the child was placed on a moderately
reduced protein diet (1.5 g kgÿ1 dayÿ1) and carnitine
supplementation (100 mg kgÿ1 dayÿ1) her progress was
poor and she showed severe developmental delay (functioning at 8 weeks at a chronological age of

in his family, born from his mother’s 3rd pregnancy. He
was born spontaneously at term by head delivery, birth
weight was 3,800 g, birth length was 51 cm, and postpartum
adaptation was uneventful. The boy’s psychomotor
development was normal, but he attended speech therapy
for a speech sound disorder. He was evaluated as socially
immature at the beginning of his schooling and was
diagnosed with dysgraphia at the age of 10 years during
an examination by a special educator. He does not ride a
bicycle because he reports that problems with coordination
and balance make it impossible for him to do so. At
14 years of age, he was examined for elevated transaminase
levels in obesity. His weight was 87.9 kg, height 174 cm,
waist circumference 104 cm (Z score 2.5), body mass index
(BMI) 29.0 kg/m2
 (Z score 2.52), and blood pressure 132/83.
Clinical examination revealed only marked gynecomastia
and sonography showed diffuse hepatic hyperechogenicity
consistent with steatosis and splenomegaly without
sonographic evidence of portal hypertension. Biochemical
results from his first outpatient examination are presented
in Table 1. His condition was concluded to be nonalcoholic fatty liver disorder with obesity and incompletely
expressed metabolic syndrome (1). Screening for IMD and
psychological examinations were also performed because of
the proband’s uneven mental skills. When tested with the
Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-III), the
boy exhibited unevenly distributed verbal and perceptual
intellectual abilities. Verbal abilities were in the upper
range of below average and perceptual abilities were in the
average range. Overall cognitive ability was in the upper
band of the below average range. The boy’s medical history
was suspicious for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD), he had a speech sound disorder, and he had been
referred to the Special Education Center for Learning
Disabilities since 5th grade.
On first admission, the patient underwent analysis
of organic acids, amino acids acylcarnitines, purines
and pyrimidines, intermediates of creatine metabolism,
acylglycines, and mucopolysaccharides in urine, serum
and blood spot. Increased excretion of N-acetylalanine,
N-acetylmethionine and N-acetylglutamine were detected
by GC/MS. Interestingly, higher urinary excretions of acetyl, propionyl and butyrylglycine with calculated z-scores
of 173.0; 154.1 and 40.3 were observed.","Farid Zare","ACY1","Yes","Aminoacylase 1 deficiency","609924","137754","PMID: 38234346",,,,

perinatal period was not contributory, motor development was in mild delay although she did not exhibit neurological signs, except for mild hypotonia and
clumsiness. Auxological parameters were normal and
no dysmorphism was evident. Her behavior was characterized by impulsivity, attention deficit, and oppositional and defiant attitude. From the biochemical,
imaging and electrophysiological examinations of the
patient only the organic acid analysis was significant. 
Urine organic acids analyses of carriers were normal

of N-acetylated amino acids (Fig. 2).
Family pedigree revealed multiple miscarriages and
mild neurodevelopmental impairments, often normalized at an older age. In particular, II:8 had a history
of motor delay and she reported three abortions; psychiatric disorders such as autism and suicides were also present in other maternal line members, as referred by the
mother of the patient. In the paternal line, II:1 reported
an abortion in his family; his elder daughter (III:2) presented with learning difficulties, spontaneously recovered during her developmental period, while the
younger (III:3) was asymptomatic and refused biochemical and genetic test.

parents. He was born at full term by elective caesarean section. His birth weight was 3.47
kg and his Apgar scores were 8 at both 1 and 5 minutes after birth. His postnatal course was
unremarkable except for a transient period of neonatal jaundice beginning on day 3, and
the peak bilirubin level of 254 μmol/L, the level readily normalised after phototherapy. The
patient was referred to Department of Paediatrics, Tseung Kwan O Hospital in January 2011
for delay in language development. At the age of 2 years, he still could not produce a single
recognisable word. Motor development was appropriate for his age. Socially the child
showed poor eye contact, but no restriction of other interests or ritualistic behaviour. On
physical examination, his weight was at 75th centile, his height at the 97th centile, and his
head circumference was in the 25th centile, all of which were normal and there were no
dysmorphic features. Neurological examination yielded nil abnormal. Routine blood test
showed that his complete blood picture, renal function test, blood gas, random glucose
and ammonia levels were not abnormal. Liver function was unremarkable except for a
mildly elevated alanine aminotransferase level of 78 U/L. Magnetic resonance imagingof the brain yielded no abnormality. Biochemical
investigations for suspected inherited metabolic
disease were performed. Urine organic acid analysis
by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry showed
markedly increased excretion of uracil, thymine,
dihydrouracil, and dihydrothymine (Fig 1). Notably,

444,"Our patient is an 18-yr-old male born at 36 wk gestation to healthy, nonconsanguineous
parents.
Maternal preeclampsia and fetal bradycardia complicated the pregnancy, and though
born with a nuchal cord, no resuscitation was required. A 5-d stay in the neonatal intensive
care unit was necessary because of prematurity. Developmental milestones were gradually
achieved, with developmental delay and spasticity first noted at ∼9 mo of age. At 3.5 yr old, a
rapid regression occurred in all developmental areas, rendering the patient unable to walk or
speak. No known infection or injury preceded this loss. Shortly after the regression, the patient developed convulsions and was diagnosed with spastic quadriplegic CP. Despite physical therapy and oral medications, spasticity intensified with age, necessitating the
implantation of a baclofen pump at ∼18 yr of age. At 18 yr, because of risk factors for low
bone density, including reduced mobility, seizure disorder, treatment with antiepileptic
medications, and a history of a ketogenic diet, bone mineral density was evaluated.
Osteoporosis was diagnosed based on low bone mineral density measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry. The patient has undergone 3 yr of bisphosphonate treatment (zoledronate),
resulting in improved bone mineral density. Initial measurements in the osteoporosis range
(lumbar spine 0.57 g/cm2 and left total hip 0.53 g/cm2
) have shown improvement in the most
recent assessments (lumbar spine 0.83 g/cm2 and left total hip 0.75 g/cm2
). Additionally, the
patient developed gastritis and feeding difficulties in the form of dysphagia, vomiting, and
gastroesophageal reflux (GERD), which required multiple admissions. Eventually, a gastrostomy tube was inserted, which alleviated the patient’s symptoms.
Imaging: Normal brain MRI results were observed at 1.5 and 3.5 yr of age. However, a subsequent
brain MRI at 16 yr revealed a mild increase in FLAIR signal in the parietal periventricular white
matter, accompanied by volume loss and periventricular leukomalacia. Around 5 yr of age,
abdominal ultrasound and echocardiogram studies yielded normal results.

These episodes persisted for several days, with clinical resolution after intravenous fluids were administrated. The patient had a history of mild learning difficulties and ‘strange behaviour’ since childhood, and had self-selected a low protein diet. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain identified symmetrical areas of increased signal in the cerebellum and basal ganglia on T2-weighted images (Fig. 2) and an EEG showed diffuse slow wave changes. The working diagnosis had been basilar migraine syndrome with ischaemia and associated epileptiform activity, although this did not fully explain the clinical or imaging abnormalities. A formal psychiatric diagnosis was considered given the unusual constellation of presenting features, the patient’s unusual affect and the onset of symptoms coinciding with the death of her father.

461,"A 5.5-month-old male infant presented with growth delay, cyanosis, perspiration during feeding, and diarrhea since the age of 3 months. Physical examination revealed tachypnea, tachycardia, and a soft murmur at the left sternal border and the cardiac apex. In the electrocardiogram, LV hypertrophy with strain was found. Echocardiography revealed a seriously dilated left ventricle with impaired systolic function (SF: 15%, LV EF: 42.2%), mitral regurgitation due to dilation, deep endomyocardial trabeculations, and a two-layered structure of the left ventricle myocardium with a non-compacted/compacted end-systolic ratio N2.0. Colour Doppler demonstrated flow within deep intertrabecular recesses in continuity with the LV cavity.




Total CK and CK-MB were normal (71 U/l and 5 U/l, respectively), while pro BNP was elevated (480 pg/ml, increased N100). Fasting lipid analysis demonstrated low triglycerides and low total cholesterol (26 mg/dl and 79 mg/dl, respectively). Through serial blood counts, severe chronic neutropenia was detected. The bone marrow smear revealed maturation arrest in the granulocyte series with dysplastic changes (maturation asynchrony and karyorrhexis). The ratio of myeloid to erythrocyte progenitors was 1:7. The patient had a normal male karyotype. There was no parental consanguinity, and the family history was negative.




Standard medical therapy for heart failure (digoxin, diuretics, and ACE inhibitors) was instituted. Neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <500 cells/μl) responded gradually to therapy with G-CSF. His neutrophil count has been sustained at levels close to 2000 cells/μl with a low dose of G-CSF (5 μg/kg/every 48 h) without having experienced any serious infections. His growth curve (weight and height) has been under the 3rd percentile, while his psychomotor development has been appropriate for his age.

462,"The boy was born at term as the first child of healthy non-consanguineous parents of Caucasian origin, with a birth weight of 2,595 g (<5th centile) and a birth length of 48 cm. The early postnatal adaptation was uneventful. Bilateral cryptorchidism was noted after birth. At the age of 4 months, he was examined because of dyspnea during breastfeeding, failure to thrive, and short stature (weight of 4.1 kg and length of 58 cm, both <3rd centile). The ECG showed sinus tachycardia with discordant T-waves and ST-segment depressions in the left precordium. Echocardiography revealed left ventricular dilation (left ventricle end-diastolic diameter (LVIDd) of 36 mm; 176% of controls; Z score +5.2) with severely decreased contractility and shortening fraction (SF) (6%, normal range 30–42%) and decreased ejection fraction (EF) of 12%. A restricted filling pattern of the left ventricle (LV) was seen with a short deceleration time of 50–65 ms.




Therapy for heart failure, consisting of digoxin, furosemide, and ACE inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme), brought no significant improvement. Skeletal myopathy with moderate gross motor development delay, together with persistent growth failure and failure to thrive (length 70 cm and weight 7.89 kg), was documented by physical examination at 21 months. Even though mild improvement in the severity of the LV dilatation (LVIDd Z score +3.5) and contractility with SF of 15% and EF of 26% was found in control echocardiography, the boy suddenly died at the age of 2 years due to malignant arrhythmia (sudden cardiac arrest).




At that time, hyperammonemia was not detected (ammonia concentration 52 µmol/l, controls <60), but severe metabolic lactic acidosis (lactate 9.1 mmol/l, controls <2.3; base deficit 13 mmol/l, controls ±2.0), moderate hepatopathy (ALT 2.51 µkat/l, AST 4.81 µkat/l, controls <0.63; creatine kinase was within reference range), and poor glycemia level control (3.2–23.8 mmol/l) were observed.

463,"The firstborn male from a physiological gestation of a healthy mother of Caucasian origin was born at 37 weeks of gestation vaginally, weighing 2,800 g and with a length of 49 cm. The early postnatal adaptation was uneventful. The condition manifested at the age of 4 months with signs of heart failure: poor feeding, dyspnea, apathy, poor peripheral perfusion, hepatomegaly, and cyanosis.
On physical examination, a loud systolic murmur was found in the whole precordium. Echocardiography revealed left ventricular dilation with EF 26% and moderate mitral regurgitation. Pharmacological therapy for heart failure was administered immediately, consisting of a combination of digoxin, carvedilol, ACE inhibitors, spironolactone, and furosemide. A remarkable improvement in cardiac parameters and gradual normalization of EF (55–60%) and LVIDd (112%) were observed on therapy (at 2 years of age). Mild mitral regurgitation persisted. Electrocardiography (Holter monitoring) documented a normal record.
Although there was moderate muscle hypotonia and delayed postural development during the first year of life, by the age of 2 years, nearly normal psychomotor development was observed. Social interaction and speech were not affected. Growth retardation was documented since 1 year of life. At three years of age, his height was 90.5 cm (5th centile) and weight 11.4 kg (weight for height <3rd centile). In addition, from birth, gradual microcephalization occurred. The head circumference (HC) declined from the 13th to the 1st centile (at the age of 3 years, HC was 46 cm), although his psychomotor development corresponded to his age.
Liver function tests were only mildly elevated (ALT 0.62 µkat/l, AST 1.1 µkat/l, controls <0.63; creatine kinase was within reference range). Levels of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were decreased (23.8 µg/l, controls 49–171; 1.9 mg/l, controls 2.83–5.18).

The grandmother’s brother (from the maternal side) died at the age of 9 years due to an unspecified heart disease, and the boy’s mother’s sister had a history of three miscarriages. Muscle hypotonia in our patient was noted shortly after birth but without any feeding problems during this period. At the age of 3 months, he was examined because of poor feeding and hyposaturation during an acute respiratory tract infection. Hepatomegaly was observed on physical examination. Cardiological investigation revealed SF of 21% (normal range of 30–42%), decreased systolic function of the left ventricle, and increased LVIDd of 200% of controls.

Cardiac function stabilized with therapy consisting of digoxin until the age of 2 years and ACE inhibitors transiently; at present, no more than regular use of a beta-blocker is necessary. Echocardiography showed left ventricular hypertrophy regression (LVIDd of 131%) at the age of 13 years. Standard ECG demonstrated a prolonged QTc of 488 milliseconds.

His psychomotor development was delayed at first. Muscle hypotonia is present until now; he is frequently more tired. However, his mental skills were always age-appropriate. He has reduced height gain and failure to thrive, but microcephaly did not emerge. At 13 years of age, his height was 148 cm (5.7th centile) and weight 29 kg (weight for height <3rd centile).

(first-degree cousins)  
second sibling with a similar presentation who currently has a tracheostomy on
conservative management. 

This patient presented with hypotonia at birth but was
discharged from the local hospital against medical advice. At 6 months of age,
she began to experience generalized tonic-clonic seizures with oculogyric
crises that lasted for a few minutes and occurred 2–3 times per week. The
patient also exhibited a range of additional signs and symptoms, including
global developmental delay, jerking of limbs, which are now believed to be
dystonic attacks, excessive crying, insomnia, severe oropharyngeal dysphagia,
and silent aspiration on thin liquid as well as autonomic symptoms including
drooling, excessive sweating and hyperthermia.





 





The patient was initially treated with supportive management
and anti-epileptic medications. At 9 months of age, she was referred for
further evaluation at KFSH-RC and underwent a brain MRI, an EEG, and a lumbar
puncture. At this time, genetic testing was requested, and the sample was sent
for whole exome sequencing and to an epilepsy gene panel (Mayo Clinic
Laboratories). Findings from the MRI scan were unremarkable, although
intermittent slow activity was reported on the EEG. CSF analysis revealed a neurotransmitter
profile including low levels of
5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA; 6 nmol/l) and homovanillic acid (HVA;
38 nmol/L), and elevated 3-OMD (>2,500 nmol/L). Pyridoxal phosphate levels
were normal (41 nmol/L), indicating that the patient did not have
pyridoxamine-5-phosphate deficiency. 
From 6 months of age, the patient was initially treated with
levetiracetam (75 mg twice daily), with subsequent addition of pyridoxine
(100 mg morning, 200 mg evening), folinic acid (5 mg/day) and
carbidopa-levodopa (2.5 mg twice daily). The patient tolerated and adhered to
the treatment; however, little symptomatic improvement was noted and she
unfortunately died at 3 years of age. The cause of death was unknown because
the patient passed away at her local hospital.


The patient was managed by multiple teams at KFSH-RC. The
pediatric nutrition team was responsible for optimizing nutrition and caloric
intake, and the patient received Infatrini formula. The patient also underwent
a swallowing assessment owing to poor oral motor skills. Based on the results
from this assessment, long-term alternative feeding was recommended to ensure
the safety and adequacy of feeding. The pediatric surgical team was involved in
G-tube insertion and performance of a Nissen fundoplication procedure to treat
gastro-esophageal reflux disease.

485,"A 4-month-old female, born to consanguineous parents of Iranian descent, presented with hypotonia and poor head control. By 7 months, she developed myoclonic seizures, which were initially controlled with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) treatment. At 3.5 years, she exhibited severe neurodevelopmental delay, hypotonia, dystonia, and ataxia. Despite therapy, she was only able to sit, crawl, and walk a few steps with assistance by the age of 4 years.

Brain MRI at 16 months showed agenesis of the corpus callosum and mild brain atrophy. Metabolic investigations revealed metabolic acidosis, increased serum lactate (24.7 mg/dL, reference <20 mg/dL), and hyperammonemia (262 μmol/dL, reference <60 μmol/dL). Urinary organic acid analysis showed elevated lactic acid, while plasma amino acid analysis revealed high glutamine and methionine levels.

486," female patient was born to consanguineous parents : she had one sister who was known to be a carrier and two other siblings with similar symptoms. 
The patient had experienced hypoxic encephalopathy since birth resulting in a cerebral palsy-like phenotype. The patient subsequently displayed multiple signs including lack of head control, tremor, global developmental delay, disturbed sleep, drooling, excessive sweating, hyperthermia, constipation, and intractable epilepsy. She was referred to a specialist center at 15 years of age for seizure and neurological management.. A brain MRI scan at this time was normal, but an EEG showed evidence of mild-to-moderate diffuse encephalopathy and intermittent high amplitude slow waves in the bifrontal area intermixed with fast activity progressing to generalized spike wave discharges, which may explain the intractable epilepsy symptoms. This patient did not receive CSF neurotransmitter analysis because her family declined a lumbar puncture procedure.

Other signs and symptoms subsequently noted include an abnormal startle reflex, insomnia, phlegm accumulation leading to several episodes of pneumonia, silent aspiration on thin and nectar-thickened liquids (no aspiration with honey-thickened liquids), excessive sweating, hyperthermia, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, and suspected epilepsy.
The patient was referred to KFSH-RC at 3 months of age for further investigation of hypotonia and hypoglycemia. He was initially reviewed by the pediatric endocrine team and subsequently the neurology, genetics, pediatric surgery, nutrition, and speech and language pathology departments have been involved in his care. G-tube feeding is currently his main source of nutrition.
The patient underwent two brain MRI scans. In the first, no definite intracranial abnormality was observed. In the second, motion-degraded, diffusion-weighted images suggested tiny non-specific foci of signal abnormality, which may represent minor markers of metabolic derangement. An EEG revealed a non-specific bioccipital abnormality often associated with sedative medication, or, rarely, cortical dysplasia. No epileptiform abnormality was observed.

488,"A 7-year-old boy with history of hypertension, familial tall stature and generalized overgrowth was admitted for persistent vomiting, mild leukocytosis of 14,700 and mycoplasma pneumonia. Initial brain MRI was reported as normal. He developed generalized tonic clonic seizures and left hemiparesis on day 3 of hospitalization. Bedside glucose and serum electrolytes were normal. Ammonia was mildly elevated at 58 µmol/L but repeat was less than 9; lipase was 1273 U/L (normal is 23–300 U/L). An emergency head CT scan was read as normal. Neurology was consulted and he was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit for closer monitoring. A video EEG in the ICU was suggestive of a right > left posterior quadrant cerebral dysfunction. Dilated funduscopic examination showed edema of the optic disc bilaterally without obscuring overlying vessels. Lumbar puncture showed an opening pressure greater than 38 cm of water (normal is less than 25 cm water) with normal cell count. He was started on acetazolamide for pseudotumor cerebri. MRV showed extensive dural venous sinus occlusive disease with extensive superficial and deep collateral veins and review of the previous brain MRI showed a filling defect in the superior sagittal sinus consistent with dural sinus thrombosis  and papilledema. Hypercoagulable work-up showed mildly decreased antithrombin III activity (80%; reference range was 83% to 128%). Factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation, lupus anticoagulant and protein S were normal and protein C activity was low (63% with reference range of 70% to 140%). Metabolic work-up showed plasma homocysteine 71.9 (reference range was 6.6 to 14.8 µmol/L); plasma amino acids showed methionine of 448 µmol/L (reference range was 14 to 50) and free homocystine was 7 (reference range was 0–2 µmol/L). Serum methylmalonic acid was 0.15 (normal is 0.0 to 0.4 µmol/L), serum folate was 14.4 (reference range is 7 to 34.1 ng/mL), serum vitamin B12 was 244 (reference is 213 to 816 pg/mL). 
Pregnancy history revealed that the patient was born at 37 weeks’ gestation. Birth weight was 3830 g. He stayed in the NICU for 3 days because of transient tachypnea. Newborn screening tests performed at 2 days of age showed elevated methionine 89.4 µmol/L (abnormal is >60; Met/Phe ratio was 2.0 with abnormal value >1.0). Second tier test reported normal total homocysteine level. The total homocysteine on the DBS was 14.9 µmol/L. The reference laboratory’s reference range was less than 15 µmol/L.
Developmentally, he walked at 15 to 17 months. He required physical and occupational therapies for fine motor delays. Cognitively he was age appropriate and performing at grade level in school. Physical examination showed a tall boy with weight and height above the 99th percentile. His BMI was above the 99th percentile. He did not have Marfanoid features. He presented to his primary care physician 8 months after with back pain that was worse with bending forward and walking. He was seen by a spine surgeon and a spine MRI showed multiple chronic compression fractures from T6 to L4 vertebrae with osteoporosis. No scoliosis was reported. Bone densitometry scan showed that lumbar mineralization was 82% of mean for age and gender which is consistent with osteopenia. Left hip mineralization was 96% that is normal but there was osteopenia of the femoral head. He has also had right ankle avulsion injury versus old fracture and left distal fibula fracture.  His treatment of HCU with Medical foods and medication continue to be a challenge at his age and his total homocysteine has been mostly above 100 µmol/L with a range of 66 µmol/L to 217.4 µmol/L on betaine therapy and low methionine medical foods.

Since birth, he has been regularly followed by his pediatrician and our center with normal growth, development, and physical exam. Newborn screening by dried blood spot was negative. The province of Quebec has the only newborn screening program that employs urine screening in addition to dried blood spot screening. This program has over 50 years of experience. Briefly, newborn urine samples are collected by parents at home at 21 days of age (compliance rate of ~90% over the years) and sent by regular mail to Sherbrooke. Samples are processed and analyzed by thin‐layer. The urine screen of this case showed a profile of cystinuria at screening of the 21‐day‐old urine filter paper sample, but with a very high increase in urinary lysine (in mmol/mol creatinine: Cystine, 96; Orn, 89; Lys, 3810; Arg, 124; creatinine, 0.16 mM).

Neurological picture during the first year of life developed into quadruspasticity, hypokinesia, facial hypomimia, dystonia, ptosis, microcephaly andsevere psychomotor retardation although thoroughgoing rehabilitation. Spasticity was prominent on lower limbs, where the contractures of hip adductors were present. Marked hypertonia due to spasticity was emphasized by generalized dystonia. The ability to walk or even crawl was not achieved. He was followed up with the diagnosis of cerebral palsy. The child remained alert and euphoric, although he had prolonged periods of lethargy with increased sweating, drooling,nasal and oropharyngeal secretions alternating with irritability, sporadic dystonic movements and oculogyric crisis accompanied with failure to thrive. At the age
of 24 months magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, electroencephalographic and neurophysiologic examinations were unremarkable. At six years of age his anthropometric parameters were severely reduced (height 94.5 cm, weight 10.2 kg, head circumference 47.5 cm; all parameters below 3rd percentile, <–3 SD). The presence of marked generalized dystonia with diurnal fluctuation accompanied
with disturbed autonomic functions and findings of elevated serum prolactin level led us to indicate CSF neurotransmitter metabolites analysis","Farid Zare","TH","Yes","Tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency","605407","101150","PMID: 22691284",,,,
504,"A 3-year-old boy was the first-born child to consanguineous Iranian parents. Pregnancy was uneventful and the child was born at 37 weeks of gestation. Feeding difficulty had been noted since early infancy, and by the age of 4 months, the inability to control the head was evident. At 6 months of age he was referred to a pediatrician because of developmental delay and involuntary movements and was diagnosed with generalized dystonia. The remainder of the neurological examination, including eye movements, was normal and electroencephalography (EEG) was unrevealing. He was started on baclofen and was lost to follow up until the age of 3. By then, there was a clear delay in motor devel- opment because he was unable to sit or walk unaided. In addition to dystonia, generalized chorea was noted (Video S1).

505,"The patients were two male brothers, aged 27 and
40 years respectively (Fig. 1: cases II-1 and II-3),
identified in institutions for mentally handicapped
persons (n = 610 male patients). Their parents were
consanguineous (first-degree cousins): The 66-year-old
mother (I-2) had learning difficulties at the school,
with normal physical examination now. The father (I-1)
did not indicate any problem. They had seven children
(5 male and 2 female). The brother (II-4) presented
severe mental retardation, behaviour disturbances and
refractory epilepsy from the first months of life. He
died at 27 years of age in the course of an epileptic
episode. The sister (II-2) also presented severe mental retardation and myelomeningocele, and deceased at
19 years of age of an unknown cause. No biochemical
or genetic studies could be performed on these two
siblings. Two further brothers (II-6, II-7), one sister
(II-5) and her son (III-1) are at present healthy.
Pregnancy, delivery and neonatal period of our
patients were uneventful. Their psychomotor develop-
ment was retarded from the first months of life. They
started to walk at 2 years of age, showed little interest
in their surroundings, with behavioural disturbances in
agreement with autistic disorder, and showed severely
delayed language acquisition. Other physical, clinical
and complementary examinations were normal. Both
patients developed epilepsy. The first seizure appeared
with fever in patient 1 (case II-1) at 17 months of age
and in patient 2 (case II-3) at 23 months of age. After
that, they suffered generalized tonic-clonic seizures
and some epileptic status episodes until the age of
24 years in patient 1 and 4 years in patient 2, when
they were controlled with antiepileptic drugs.
From infancy to adulthood, they improved in motor
development, showing mild delay in acquisition. Lan-
guage and social aspects evolved slowly, without acquis-
itions after the first years of life. At present, according to
the results obtained with Vineland_s adaptative behav-
ioural scale (VABS), they have a profound mental
retardation, with low results in four domains assessed:
communication (direct points scored (DPS) = 24 in both
patients), daily living skills (DP = 42 in both patients),
socialization (DP = 34 in both patients) and motor skills
(DP = 38 and DP = 39 respectively). They have not
developed spoken language, having only 5–6 referential
words and with poor communicative interest. They can
understand only very simple instructions, they are not
able to communicate using signs or gestures and they
exhibit an autistic-like disorder with hyperactive behav-
iour. Neither gastrointestinal problems nor movement
disorders were present. The clinical course has been
static and our patients did not develop new symptoms
after infancy. Patient 1 shows flat malar region with a normal head circumference (55 cm; 10–25th centile)

significant for prematurity at 29 weeks, developmental delay, cerebral
palsy, spastic quadriplegia, and intractable epilepsy secondary to
Lennox–Gastaut syndrome was referred to the outpatient dermatology
clinic with a chief complaint of blistering sores scattered on the face.
The patient's longstanding epilepsy had been controlled with clobazam
30 mg daily and rufinamide 600 mg daily. The lesions started 1 year
prior, initially over the site where surgical tape had been used on her
face after a procedure requiring general anesthesia. In addition, the
mother reported that the patient had been biting her hands more fre-
quently with increasing numbers of sores developing at multiple sites
including her face and hands. She also developed redness and swelling
of her feet. A review of systems was significant for chronic vomiting and constipation. Before referral to dermatology, her initial outpatient
management included arm immobilizers (to reduce friction and scratch-
ing) and topical medications including mupirocin, terbinafine, scar-
reduction gels, and vitamin E. No improvement was seen with any prior
treatments and the etiology of the lesions remained unclear.
On initial physical exam, widespread, crusted erosions, bullae, and
atrophic scars were noted on the forehead, nasal root, and cheeks
(Figure 1A). Similar findings were found on the dorsal hands with the
addition of scattered milia (Figure 1B). Additionally, there was edema of
the feet with mild, diffuse erythema and some maceration between the
toes. A basic metabolic panel was within normal limits
and a complete blood count was notable for a mildly elevated hemoglo-
bin level of 13.9 g/dl and hematocrit level of 42.2%. Transaminitis was
present, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 66 IU/L and an
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 63 IU/L. A superficial wound culture
was obtained from the left hand to rule out primary or superimposed
infection which subsequently showed normal skin flora. A shave biopsy
of the right dorsal hand stained with hematoxylin and eosin revealed a
subepidermal blistering dermatitis with scant inflammation, dermal
papillae protrusion into the blister, and perivascular hyaline suggestive
of porphyria (Figure 2A–C). A second shave biopsy of the right dorsal
hand showed patchy perivascular positivity for C3, IgG, IgA, IgM, and
fibrinogen on direct immunofluorescence without significant staining of
the epidermal basement membrane. Subsequently, markedly elevated
total serum porphyrins and fractionated urinary porphyrins were mea-
sured (Table 1). Serum tests for hepatitis C and human immunodefi-

born following the mother’s first pregnancy.
The mother had epilepsy as a child but had
not undergone therapy for 8 years. After an uneventful pregnancy, birth was induced
vaginally at 40 weeks of gestation because
of pathological cardiotocography results;
the amniotic fluid was meconium-stained,
and the umbilical cord was twisted around
the infant’s neck twice. His birth weight and
head circumference were 3150 g (10th–50th
percentile) and 37 cm (95th percentile),
respectively. The mother was febrile
(38.2 C) during labour. Additionally, the
boy’s markers of inflammation subsequently
became mildly elevated, and he received
antibiotic therapy for early sepsis. Severe
multiple arthrogryposes of the distal joints
and muscular hypotonia were also observed
immediately after birth. Most of the extended examinations performed in
the neonatal period (i.e., electroencephalography,
electromyography, echocardiography,
and ultrasound of the abdomen and
hips) showed normal results; however, an
ultrasound of the head was mildly abnormal.

514,"A 10-year-old female presented to a pediatric outpatient setting with complaints of fever, cough, and noisy breathing. She had been followed regularly by the pediatric department, where her treatment was carried out since her diagnosis of Hurler syndrome at the age of six years. 

Her medical history revealed that she was born to second-degree consanguineous parents, but all family members, including her parents, are well. She was an average-size full-term neonate, and there were no complications at birth. She presented with bloating, vomiting, and on-and-off episodes of diarrhea at 18 months of age. These symptoms persisted for a long time despite symptomatic treatment. At the age of four, she had her first of many respiratory tract infections, i.e., fever, cough, and noisy breathing. The patient was brought to the hospital to consult her speech delay and on-and-off ear infections when she was 4.5 years of age. Later, she reported difficulty in nasal breathing and corneal clouding at eight years and 10 years, respectively. 

Gross facial dysmorphism was noted in the form of frontal bossing, broad-based nose, large protruded tongue, puffy eyes and face, and coarse facial features. She had a short neck, small chest, distended abdomen, umbilical hernia, clubbing of fingers, and flexion of the distal first interphalangeal joint. Her skin was pale, coarse, dry, and scaly with a dusky complexion. She weighed 9 kg, and her height was 91 cm, which showed her weight:height, height:age, and weight:age ratios were below the normal range. Abdominal examination revealed hepatosplenomegaly, and there was no shifting dullness or fluid thrill. Further, bilateral corneal opacities were found. 

Hematological investigations showed microcytic anemia along with a mild increase in alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Urine tests (random/spot) showed elevated mucopolysaccharides. Enzyme analysis of alpha-L-iduronidase showed deficient enzyme levels, i.e., 0.3 umol/L of blood/h (normal range: 3.5-13 umol/L of blood/h). The thyroid hormone profile was normal. 

On radiological examinations, X-ray of the skull showed a J-shaped sella (Figure 1). On chest x-ray, flattened, oar-shaped ribs (narrowed at vertebral ends and wide at sternal ends) were seen (Figure 2). X-ray of the spine showed prominent inferior beaking (Figure 3).

515,"Our patient was a 15-month-old boy, who initially presented with cardiomyopathy at the age of three weeks. He was born at 35 6/7 weeks gestation, weighing 3.929 kg (87th percentile; z score: 1.13). The rest of the growth parameters included a length of 54 cm (93rd percentile; z score: 1.53) and head circumference of 35.6 cm (44th percentile; z score: −0.13). The delivery was complicated by breech presentation, necessitating cesarean section, and the patient was large for his gestational age. He had an abnormal NBS that was concerning for a high dermatan sulfate level of 2400 nmol/L (reference range: <200) and heparan sulfate level of 608 nmol/L (reference range: <96) at the age of 5 days. He had an uncomplicated postnatal period, and passed congenital heart disease screening, with 99% oxygen saturation in the right hand and 98% in the right foot. He passed the newborn hearing screening in the right ear, while he failed on the left side.

Family history was significant, as the patient’s older sister presented with coarse dysmorphic features, development delays, and sensorineural hearing loss at the age of 9 months, leading to the diagnosis of MPS IH. She had a successful HSCT at the age of 14 months. With the history of Hurler syndrome in this older sibling, our patient underwent a molecular analysis (del/dup and sequencing) of α-L-iduronidase (IDUA) gene, revealing a homozygous pathogenic variant c.208C > T (p.Gln70*/Q70X). He was started on ERT with weekly laronidase infusion at 27 days of life at 0.5 mg/kg/week. His initial cardiac evaluation at the age of three weeks showed a moderately depressed ejection fraction (EF) of 28%, with moderately depressed left ventricular systolic function and mild-to-moderate left ventricular enlargement. A patent foramen ovale with a 6 mm Hg gradient across it suggested elevated left atrial pressure and mild mitral regurgitation. Physical examination was completely normal except for mild tachypnea and a small umbilical hernia. Ophthalmological evaluation around the same age showed mild corneal clouding. Audiological examination detected hearing loss that was largely sensorineural.

Around 6 weeks of age, he was admitted to the hospital for worsening of the EF (27%) and left ventricular function, resulting in the initiation of milrinone infusion despite weekly ERT. He was otherwise in his normal state of health. He had received three doses of ERT before admission. Intravenous milrinone therapy at 0.75 mcg/kg/min, along with the ERT, improved EF to 50% during that admission. The patient was discharged home on 0.5 mcg/kg/min of milrinone with an EF of 42%. His N-terminal-pro BNP was elevated at 9382 pg/mL (reference range: 0–1000), and troponin was slightly above normal at 0.065 ug/L (reference range: 0–0.045). He was evaluated for bone marrow transplantation, but it was somewhat delayed due to his refractory cardiac phenotype. A cardiomyopathy panel sent to evaluate for other possible causes of cardiomyopathy returned normal, without any variants in any of the tested genes. A neuropsychological evaluation conducted at the age of 4 months before HSCT showed his development to be appropriate for his age. A skeletal survey conducted at the age of 4 months was normal except for a J-shaped sella turcica and mild beaking of the inferior lumbar vertebrae. Physical examination was not suggestive of any hepatosplenomegaly.

The patient had an unrelated 7/8 human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched umbilical cord blood transplant at the age of 4 months. The post-HSCT course was uneventful, with a hospitalization that lasted 24 days. He was weaned off the milrinone infusion and had an EF of 62% at the time of discharge. He had 100% engrafting in the myeloid compartment on day 21 post-HSCT, and remained fully engrafted during the recent clinic visit, one year post-transplant. He continues to be on ERT with laronidase at 0.5 mg/kg every week at 15 months of age. His most recent neuropsychology evaluation at the age of 11 months (6 months post-HSCT) showed continued acquisition of developmental skills across all domains, without any developmental regression. Six months post-HSCT, α-iduronidase activity in the leukocytes was normal at 24.78 nmol/h/mg (reference range: 6.0–71.4), and in the plasma it was slightly low at 2.37 nmol/h/mg (reference range: 3.0–50.2), and the patient had negative IgG anti-laronidase antibody status. His plasma GAG showed near-normal concentrations of dermatan sulfate (132 nmol/L; reference range: </=130) and normal heparan sulfate (43 nmol/L; reference range: </=95), while urine GAG showed increased excretion of heparan sulfate (0.84 mg/mmol Cr; reference range: </=0.50) and dermatan sulfate (1.10 mg/mmol Cr; reference range: </=1.00). His N-terminal BNP continues to be normalized at 1 year post-HSCT, at 78 pg/mL (reference range: 0–1000), and with troponin I at <0.015 μg/L (reference range: 0–0.045).","Marina Wasef","IDUA","No","Hurler syndrome","607014","93473","https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9331972/",,,,

His-neuropsychological evaluation revealed a borderline normal intellectual capacity. There was no family history of (hereditary) neurological disease, although the parents of the subject were relatives (distant cousins).
Physical (non-neurologic) examination showed no abnormalities. Neurologic examination revealed nystagmus, cerebellar ataxia of upper and lower limbs, pyramidal tract signs more pronounced in the lower limbs causing a spastic-ataxic gait and a marked defect in proprioception and pallesthesia. Muscle strength was mildly decreased only in the distal muscles of the lower limbs symmetrically. A symmetrical atrophy of the intrinsic foot muscles has been also noted.

519,"The patient was a 50-year-old Japanese woman from non- consanguineous parents. She has no siblings but had a child. There was no apparent family history (parents, child and parent’s siblings) of neurological disorders, cardiovascular diseases or any lipid storage diseases inducing xanthomas, including CTX. She had no history of neonatal jaundice or chronic infantile diarrhea.  She insidiously developed painless tendon thickness of the bilateral Achilles tendons and right triceps muscle at 47 years of age. The gradual enlargement of the Achilles tendons caused gait disturbance when she was 49 years of age. T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance im- aging (MRI) revealed low-intensity lesions in the thickened bilateral Achilles tendons (Fig. 1A) and right triceps muscle,suggestive of xanthomas.
The patient was lean (height 149.0 cm, weight 39.2 kg, BMI 17.7 kg/m2), and the findings of a physical examination were unremarkable except for confirmation of xanthomas on the bilateral Achilles tendons (Fig. 1B) and right triceps muscle. She had age-appropriate slight cataracts in the bilat- eral eyes and did not have dementia based on the Revised Hasegawa Dementia Scale (HSD-R; 26/30), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; 27/30), and Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB; 16/18) scores. On a neurological examination, her gait appeared somewhat spastic, and all of her deep ten- don reflexes were mildly enhanced bilaterally with positive Babinski and Chaddock reflexes, indicating impairment in the bilateral pyramidal tracts. There were no neurological findings suggesting cerebellar impairment.","Farid Zare","CYP27A1","Yes","Sterol 27-hydroxylase deficiency","213700","909","PMID: 29434128",,,,

522,"The patient, a Caucasian female from non-consanguineous parents, came to clinical attention at the age of 5 years. The clinical documentation reported that the patient was affected by a slowly progressive cognitive regression. At the age of 10 years, she underwent bilateral cataract surgery. From the childhood, the patient was suffering from frequent episodes of chronic diarrhea lasting few weeks. Moreover, from the age of 20 years, the patient showed postural instability and walking difficulty. At the age of 28 years, the patient was referred to our observation for further investigations.

The study was performed according to the current version of the Helsinki Declaration and informed consent was obtained for the patient.

The neurological evaluation revealed unexpressive facies with open mouth and protruded tongue, ataxo-spastic gait, pyramidal and cerebellar syndrome, thermo-dolorific hypoesthesia, and low sensation of vibration in upper and lower limbs; Conley Scale 8. Furthermore, the patient showed disinhibited behavior together with positive glabellar and applause signs. Neuropsychological evaluation revealed intellectual disability and severe cognitive dysfunctions by Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale—Revised test (WAIS-R) with a total score less than 45 (normal range 90–109) with impairment of activities of daily living index (ADL) (5/6) and instrumental activities of daily living index IADL (2/8).

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed two symmetric areas of T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity deeply located in the cerebellar deep white matter, peripherally to the dentate nuclei (Fig. 1a, b). The susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) revealed some little peri-dentate hypointensities compatible with calcifications (Fig. 1e), subsequently confirmed with computed tomography (CT). Subtle T2 and FLAIR hyperintensities of the inferior olivary nuclei and hemispheric cerebellar atrophy were also present and related to deafferentation phenomena of the Guillain Mollaret triangles. Frontal lobes were quite atrophic too. Brain cortico-spinal tracts were hyperintense on T2 and FLAIR-weighted sequences (Fig. 1d). A rarely reported involvement of the cervical spinal cord at the level of the lateral cortico-spinal tracts and of the dorsal columns was also noted.","Farid Zare","CYP27A1","Yes","Sterol 27-hydroxylase deficiency","213700","909","PMID: 31875301",,,,

529,"The patient is a male infant born to healthy non- consanguineous Lithuanian parents. The mother’s age at delivery was 32 years old, and this was her first preg- nancy. From the 31st week of pregnancy, she started to complain about pain in her left flank. Acute pyeloneph- ritis was suspected and antibiotics were prescribed, but he urine culture was negative. The foetal ultrasound in the 31st week was normal. Since the pain deteriorated, on the 33rd week ultrasound was repeated and revealed foetal ascites, hydrocele, hepatosplenomegaly, moderate anaemia, tricuspid regurgitation, and polyhydramnios. Because of the critical foetal condition, an urgent C- section was performed. The male infant weighed 2 676 g and had a height of 48 cm and occipital-frontal circum- ference of 33.5 cm. The Apgar score was 8–8. Immedi- ately after birth, hepatosplenomegaly, ascites and hydrothorax were observed. In the first week of life, a diffuse maculopapular rash appeared. Laboratory data showed severe anaemia, intense acute phase reaction, direct hyperbilirubinemia, elevated liver enzymes, meta- bolic acidosis, and hypokalaemia. TORCH titters, as well as blood and spinal fluid cultures, were negative. From the first hours of life, the new-born was treated with red blood cell transfusions, empiric antibiotics, sodium bi- carbonate, and ursodeoxycholic acid. There was no therapeutic response to empiric antibiotics. On the 7th day of life, feeding problems, lethargy, and hypotonia were observed. At the end of the 2nd week, bloody diar- rhoea, failure to thrive, and short (1–2-day) recurrent fe- brile episodes started.

530,"An 8.5-year-old male, the second child of non-consanguineous, healthy parents, was referred to our department due to academic difficulties, along with language and attention-related concerns. The child exhibited restlessness, impulsivity, forgetfulness, absent-mindedness, and disorganization. Despite these challenges, he was sociable, affable, and talkative.

He was born at 39 weeks via an uncomplicated cesarean section, which was performed due to breech presentation. His mother was 34 years old at the time of delivery. Birth weight was 3800 g (75th percentile), and the occipitofrontal diameter (OFD) was 34 cm (15th percentile). The family history was unremarkable, and he had two healthy sisters.

On clinical examination, his weight was 29 kg (70th percentile), height was 132 cm (70th percentile), and OFD was 50.5 cm (10th percentile). Facial features included a long triangular face, sparse lateral eyebrows, upslanting palpebral fissures, almond-shaped eyes, a long nose, protruding ears, and a thin upper lip. No osteoarticular or genital anomalies were noted.

Developmental milestones were within the normal range. He walked unsupported at 15 months, though the family reported poor coordination. His early verbal and nonverbal communication skills appeared typical, with the first bisyllabic words occurring at 12 months. By the age of 3 years, he formed simple sentences, albeit with some phonological difficulties. Growth parameters remained within normal limits, with head circumference consistently between the 10th and 17th percentiles.","Mohammad faiz Khan","PQBP1","Y","","309500","3242","PMID: 34470565 DOI: 10.1080/21622965.2021.1970551","{""HP:0000219"":""Thin upper lip vermilion"",""HP:0000325"":""Triangular face"",""HP:0000411"":""Protruding ear"",""HP:0000582"":""Upslanted palpebral fissure"",""HP:0000711"":""Restlessness"",""HP:0001623"":""Breech presentation"",""HP:0002354"":""Memory impairment"",""HP:0002370"":""Poor coordination"",""HP:0002463"":""Language impairment"",""HP:0003189"":""Long nose"",""HP:0005338"":""Sparse lateral eyebrow"",""HP:0007018"":""Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder"",""HP:0007874"":""Almond-shaped palpebral fissure"",""HP:0100710"":""Impulsivity""}","{""HP:0002463"":""Language impairment"",""HP:0000750"":""Language development deficit"",""HP:0002167"":""Speech impairment"",""HP:0007018"":""Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder"",""HP:0000711"":""Restlessness"",""HP:0012452"":""Restless legs syndrome"",""HP:0002360"":""Sleep disturbance"",""HP:0100710"":""Impulsive"",""HP:0000752"":""Hyperactivity"",""HP:0002354"":""Forgetfulness"",""HP:0007017"":""Forgetfullness"",""HP:0001289"":""Disorientation"",""HP:0001623"":""Breech presentation at birth"",""HP:0010861"":""Incomplete breech presentation"",""HP:0010860"":""Complete breech presentation"",""HP:0000325"":""Triangular facies"",""HP:0000274"":""Short and narrow face"",""HP:0005338"":""Sparse lateral eyebrows"",""HP:0100840"":""Sparse or absent eyebrows"",""HP:0000582"":""Upslanted palpebral fissure"",""HP:0000494"":""Downslanting palpebral fissures"",""HP:0007874"":""Almond-shaped opening between the eyelids"",""HP:0007835"":""S-shaped eyes"",""HP:0000316"":""Wide-set eyes"",""HP:0003189"":""Elongated nose"",""HP:0000448"":""Big nose"",""HP:0003196"":""Short nose"",""HP:0000411"":""Prominent ears"",""HP:0040080"":""Anteverted ears"",""HP:0000215"":""Thick upper lip"",""HP:0000179"":""Thick lower lip"",""HP:0000219"":""Thin upper lip"",""HP:0002370"":""Poor coordination"",""HP:0011443"":""Coordination issue"",""HP:0002311"":""Incoordination"",""HP:0009088"":""Speech articulation difficulties""}","[""OMIM:619950"",""ORPHA:2044"",""OMIM:301069"",""OMIM:619841"",""OMIM:176270"",""OMIM:309590"",""OMIM:309500"",""OMIM:619504"",""OMIM:617854"",""OMIM:619475"",""ORPHA:261337"",""OMIM:615502"",""ORPHA:96148"",""OMIM:614923"",""OMIM:300534"",""ORPHA:589905"",""OMIM:301030"",""ORPHA:98818"",""OMIM:619312"",""OMIM:620494""]","[""Tessadori-van Haaften neurodevelopmental syndrome 3"",""Floating-Harbor syndrome"",""Chromosome Xq13 duplication syndrome"",""Chilton-Okur-Chung neurodevelopmental syndrome"",""Prader-Willi syndrome"",""Mental retardation, x-linked syndromic, Turner type"",""Renpenning syndrome"",""Chopra-Amiel-Gordon syndrome"",""Intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal dominant 56"",""Developmental delay, impaired speech, and behavioral abnormalities"",""Distal 22q11.2 microduplication syndrome"",""Intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal dominant 21"",""Distal deletion 10q"",""Branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase kinase deficiency"",""Intellectual developmental disorder, X-linked syndromic, Claes-Jensen type"",""PHIP-related behavioral problems-intellectual disability-obesity-dysmorphic features syndrome"",""Van Esch-O'Driscoll syndrome"",""Landau-Kleffner syndrome"",""Radio-Tartaglia syndrome"",""Neurodevelopmental disorder with impaired language, behavioral abnormalities, and dysmorphic facies""]"
531,"This case report describes an 11-year-old male who was born following a full-term, uncomplicated pregnancy. Developmental milestones were mildly delayed, particularly in speech. He sat independently at eight months, crawled at 12 months, and walked at 15 months. His first words emerged at 12 months, but language development progressed slowly toward complexity.

At the age of seven, a psychological assessment indicated intellectual functioning within the range of mild intellectual disability, with a higher verbal than nonverbal score. Behaviorally, he exhibited low frustration tolerance and hyperactivity. He currently attends a primary school within a specialized individual education program and is well-integrated with his peers.

Morphological abnormalities included a small head circumference at birth (30 cm, below the 3rd percentile), a wide nasal bridge, midfacial and maxillary underdevelopment, a short philtrum, low-set ears, a low-hanging columella, a high palate, and a narrow face. Neurological examination revealed hypotonia in both upper and lower extremities with joint hypermobility, while the remainder of the neurological findings were unremarkable. Cardiac examination detected a systolic murmur graded 2/6, and echocardiography identified chordae tendineae abnormalities in the left ventricle, which were not clinically significant.

The patient experienced his first seizure at the age of seven, followed by four nocturnal seizures by the age of nine. Seizures began with nausea, an urge to vomit, a blank stare, and unresponsiveness, lasting up to three minutes. Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed focal epileptiform activity in the left anterior region. He was prescribed lamotrigine at a dose of 5 mg/kg. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated mild asymmetry of the cerebellar hemispheres, with mild hypoplasia of the right cerebellar hemisphere, but no other pathological findings.

Over the next 18 months, he remained seizure-free, and EEG findings were unremarkable on two occasions. However, at the age of 10, he experienced a seizure exacerbation with five episodes within one month, without known triggers. The semiology of these seizures included head and sideways deviation, body cramping, jaw clenching, lack of responsiveness, and sweating. Seizures lasted one to three minutes, corresponding to sleep-onset seizures evolving into bilateral motor seizures. Increasing the lamotrigine dose resulted in improvement, with only one recurrence at the age of 11. At that time, his weight was 26 kg, and his height was 110 cm, indicating short stature.

Genetic analysis revealed a male karyotype (46, XY). Further exome sequencing identified a frameshift mutation in the polar reach domain (PRD) of the PQBP1 gene (c.459-462 delAGAG). The patient's mother was found to be a heterozygous carrier of the same mutation.","FKM","PQBP1","Yes","RENPENNING SYNDROME","309500","3242","PMID: 34470565 DOI: 10.1080/21622965.2021.1970551","{""HP:0000219"":""Thin upper lip vermilion"",""HP:0000325"":""Triangular face"",""HP:0000411"":""Protruding ear"",""HP:0000582"":""Upslanted palpebral fissure"",""HP:0000711"":""Restlessness"",""HP:0000752"":""Hyperactivity"",""HP:0001623"":""Breech presentation"",""HP:0002354"":""Memory impairment"",""HP:0002370"":""Poor coordination"",""HP:0002463"":""Language impairment"",""HP:0003189"":""Long nose"",""HP:0005338"":""Sparse lateral eyebrow"",""HP:0007018"":""Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder"",""HP:0007874"":""Almond-shaped palpebral fissure"",""HP:0100710"":""Impulsivity""}","{""HP:0002463"":""Language impairment"",""HP:0000750"":""Language development deficit"",""HP:0002167"":""Speech impairment"",""HP:0007018"":""Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder"",""HP:0000711"":""Restlessness"",""HP:0012452"":""Restless legs syndrome"",""HP:0002360"":""Sleep disturbance"",""HP:0100710"":""Impulsive"",""HP:0000752"":""Hyperactivity"",""HP:0002354"":""Forgetfulness"",""HP:0007017"":""Forgetfullness"",""HP:0001289"":""Disorientation"",""HP:0001623"":""Breech presentation at birth"",""HP:0010861"":""Incomplete breech presentation"",""HP:0010860"":""Complete breech presentation"",""HP:0000325"":""Triangular facies"",""HP:0000274"":""Short and narrow face"",""HP:0005338"":""Sparse lateral eyebrows"",""HP:0100840"":""Sparse or absent eyebrows"",""HP:0000582"":""Upslanted palpebral fissure"",""HP:0000494"":""Downslanting palpebral fissures"",""HP:0007874"":""Almond-shaped opening between the eyelids"",""HP:0007835"":""S-shaped eyes"",""HP:0000316"":""Wide-set eyes"",""HP:0003189"":""Elongated nose"",""HP:0000448"":""Big nose"",""HP:0003196"":""Short nose"",""HP:0000411"":""Prominent ears"",""HP:0040080"":""Anteverted ears"",""HP:0000215"":""Thick upper lip"",""HP:0000179"":""Thick lower lip"",""HP:0000219"":""Thin upper lip"",""HP:0002370"":""Poor coordination"",""HP:0011443"":""Coordination issue"",""HP:0002311"":""Incoordination"",""HP:0009088"":""Speech articulation difficulties""}","[""OMIM:301069"",""OMIM:619950"",""OMIM:309590"",""OMIM:619475"",""OMIM:614923"",""ORPHA:2044"",""OMIM:619841"",""OMIM:176270"",""OMIM:300534"",""OMIM:309500"",""OMIM:619504"",""ORPHA:98818"",""OMIM:617854"",""OMIM:613406"",""ORPHA:261337"",""OMIM:609625"",""OMIM:615502"",""ORPHA:96148"",""OMIM:180849"",""OMIM:223370""]","[""Chromosome Xq13 duplication syndrome"",""Tessadori-van Haaften neurodevelopmental syndrome 3"",""Mental retardation, x-linked syndromic, Turner type"",""Developmental delay, impaired speech, and behavioral abnormalities"",""Branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase kinase deficiency"",""Floating-Harbor syndrome"",""Chilton-Okur-Chung neurodevelopmental syndrome"",""Prader-Willi syndrome"",""Intellectual developmental disorder, X-linked syndromic, Claes-Jensen type"",""Renpenning syndrome"",""Chopra-Amiel-Gordon syndrome"",""Landau-Kleffner syndrome"",""Intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal dominant 56"",""Witteveen-Kolk syndrome"",""Distal 22q11.2 microduplication syndrome"",""Chromosome 10q26 deletion syndrome"",""Intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal dominant 21"",""Distal deletion 10q"",""Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome 1"",""Dubowitz syndrome""]"
532,"A 23-month-old boy was referred to the pediatric endocrinology clinic from the pediatric cardiology clinic for evaluation of a genetic syndrome characterized by a cardiac anomaly, developmental delay, and microcephaly. He was born at 41 weeks of gestation via vaginal delivery, with no reported perinatal complications. His birth weight was 3040 g, placing him between the 25th and 40th percentiles.

The patient exhibited microcephaly, global developmental delay, dysmorphic facial features, and an atrial septal defect. At 23 months of age, he underwent surgical closure of the atrial septal defect using an autologous pericardial patch. By the age of 3 years and 3 months, his height was 95.5 cm (standard deviation score: −1.30), and his weight was 12.6 kg (standard deviation score: −0.04). His head circumference measured 42 cm, which was below the 3rd percentile. Distinct facial characteristics included a narrow face, arched eyebrows, protruding ears, a bulbous nose, and prognathism. Additionally, he had limited range of motion in the right arm during supination. His motor development allowed him to run independently and ascend stairs with a hand grasp. His cognitive and fine motor abilities enabled him to copy a line, stack six cubes, and imitate parental motions. However, his expressive language development was delayed, as he could only inaccurately pronounce three words, while his receptive language skills remained intact.

Routine laboratory investigations, including complete blood count, serum electrolytes, glucose, blood gases, hepatic and renal function tests, and urinalysis, yielded normal results. Chromosomal analysis confirmed a 46, XY karyotype. A forearm X-ray identified the presence of right radioulnar synostosis.

Considering the combination of radioulnar synostosis and microcephaly, differential diagnoses included Guiffré–Tsukahara syndrome and Antley–Bixler syndrome. Genetic testing was conducted to investigate pathogenic variants associated with conditions involving short stature, microcephaly, and intellectual disability. Informed consent was obtained from the patient’s parents, and the study was approved by the institutional review board. A blood sample (3 cc) was collected from the patient and both parents, and genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood.

Targeted exome sequencing was performed using a panel designed to enrich clinically relevant genes. The sequencing process involved mapping reads to a standard human genome reference for comparative analysis. The results identified a novel hemizygous frameshift mutation, c.559delT (p.Tyr187llefs*8), in the PQBP1 gene. Direct sequencing confirmed this variant, which was present in a heterozygous state in the patient’s mother but absent in the father. Both parents exhibited a normal phenotype. The sequencing panel had an average depth of 86X, with 97.5% of bases covered above 10X. No pathogenic variants were detected in FGFR2 and POR genes, which are associated with Antley–Bixler syndrome.

This frameshift variant in PQBP1 had not been previously reported and was absent in control databases, including the 1000 Genomes Project, the Exome Variant Server, and ExAC. Given its truncating nature and absence in population controls, this mutation was classified as likely pathogenic according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines.","FKM","PQBP1","Yes","RENPENNING SYNDROME","309500","3242","PMID: 30143497","{""HP:0000252"":""Microcephaly"",""HP:0000275"":""Narrow face"",""HP:0000303"":""Mandibular prognathia"",""HP:0000411"":""Protruding ear"",""HP:0001263"":""Global developmental delay"",""HP:0001631"":""Atrial septal defect"",""HP:0001999"":""Abnormal facial shape"",""HP:0002474"":""Expressive language delay"",""HP:0002553"":""Highly arched eyebrow"",""HP:0002974"":""Radioulnar synostosis"",""HP:0011451"":""Congenital microcephaly""}","{""HP:0000252"":""Microcephaly"",""HP:0011451"":""Congenital microcephaly"",""HP:0005484"":""Secondary microcephaly"",""HP:0001263"":""Developmental delay, global"",""HP:0011342"":""Mild global developmental delay"",""HP:0011344"":""Severe global developmental delay"",""HP:0001999"":""Facial dysmorphism"",""HP:0430026"":""Dysmorphic midface"",""HP:0001631"":""Atrial septum defect"",""HP:0001674"":""Complete atrioventricular septal defect"",""HP:0006695"":""Atrioventricular septal defect"",""HP:0000275"":""Narrow face"",""HP:0000274"":""Short and narrow face"",""HP:0012801"":""Narrow lower face"",""HP:0000460"":""Narrow nose"",""HP:0002553"":""Highly arched eyebrow"",""HP:0000411"":""Prominent ears"",""HP:0040080"":""Anteverted ears"",""HP:0000303"":""Mandible prognathism"",""HP:0430028"":""Prognathia of the upper jaw"",""HP:0002996"":""Limited elbow mobility"",""HP:0006248"":""Limited wrist movement"",""HP:0000466"":""Limited neck range of motion"",""HP:0002974"":""Radioulnar synostosis"",""HP:0003939"":""Humeroulnar synostosis"",""HP:0005037"":""Proximal radio-ulnar synostosis"",""HP:0003041"":""Humeroradial synostosis"",""HP:0002474"":""Expressive language delay"",""HP:0011346"":""Mild expressive language delay"",""HP:0006863"":""Severe expressive language delay"",""HP:0000750"":""Delayed speech and language development"",""HP:0011350"":""Mild receptive language delay"",""HP:0011351"":""Moderate receptive language delay"",""HP:0010863"":""Receptive language delay"",""HP:0011352"":""Severe receptive language delay""}","[""OMIM:615502"",""OMIM:309500"",""OMIM:616268"",""OMIM:618089"",""OMIM:612474"",""ORPHA:329224"",""ORPHA:261552"",""OMIM:117550"",""ORPHA:904"",""OMIM:619325"",""OMIM:610883"",""OMIM:194190"",""OMIM:616777"",""ORPHA:500533"",""OMIM:610759"",""ORPHA:391408"",""OMIM:156200"",""OMIM:303600"",""OMIM:618622"",""OMIM:259775""]","[""Intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal dominant 21"",""Renpenning syndrome"",""Arboleda-Tham syndrome"",""Intellectual developmental disorder with dysmorphic facies and behavioral abnormalities"",""Chromosome 1q21.1 deletion syndrome, 1.35-mb"",""Schuurs-Hoeijmakers syndrome"",""Mowat-Wilson syndrome due to a ZEB2 point mutation"",""Sotos syndrome"",""Williams syndrome"",""Coffin-Siris syndrome 12"",""Potocki-Lupski syndrome"",""Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome"",""Seckel syndrome 9"",""Polyhydramnios-megalencephaly-symptomatic epilepsy syndrome"",""Cornelia de Lange syndrome 3"",""Primary microcephaly-mild intellectual disability-young-onset diabetes syndrome"",""Mental retardation, autosomal dominant 1"",""Coffin-Lowry syndrome"",""Neurodevelopmental disorder with microcephaly, arthrogryposis, and structural brain anomalies"",""Raine syndrome""]"
533," a female of South Asian heritage, is the third child of parents with no family history of intellectual disabilities or congenital anomalies. During the third trimester of pregnancy, intrauterine growth retardation was detected, leading to an induced vaginal delivery at 37 weeks. At birth, the mother was 35 years old and the father was 42 years old. The infant measured 40.6 cm in length (0.3rd percentile) and weighed 2.4 kg (16th percentile).

Between 9 and 10 months of age, she was noted to have a small head circumference. Visual impairment was identified early, and she was diagnosed with right-sided ocular abnormalities, including a small eye and a congenital lens opacity. By the age of 2 years and 10 months, her height was 87 cm (4th percentile), her weight was 10.6 kg (3rd percentile), and her head circumference was 43.5 cm (0.1st percentile, −3.4 SD).

Distinct facial and craniofacial features were observed, including upward-slanting eyelid openings, a prominent nasal tip, a short groove between the nose and upper lip, underdeveloped midfacial and maxillary regions, a high-arched palate, mild asymmetry of the lower jaw, a protruding lower jaw, a long and triangular face, and inward curvature of the fifth fingers. Pigmented linear streaks were present on her back, buttocks, and left arm. Increased muscle tone was noted in the limbs. By 4.5 years of age, streaky and whorled pigmentation following characteristic dermatological patterns became more apparent on her right lower back, right buttocks, and upper thighs. By 10 years of age, these pigmented streaks had faded, while light-colored patches appeared on her upper arms. At this time, she was diagnosed with mild hearing loss in the low-frequency range in her right ear and mild-to-moderate conductive hearing loss in her left ear. At 13 years of age, she experienced vision loss in her right eye due to retinal detachment.

Her developmental milestones were delayed. She sat independently at 9.5 months, crawled at 11 months, and walked at 16.5 months. At 2 years and 10 months, she spoke a few words and showed an interest in simple puzzles. By 4 years of age, she had developed a refined pincer grasp, was able to follow basic one-step instructions, and could dress and undress herself with assistance for buttons. By 4 years and 9 months, she was speaking in short phrases of 2–3 words and frequently used gestures to communicate, although her eye contact was reduced. A developmental psychological assessment at the same age indicated mild intellectual disability. Cognitive testing revealed difficulties in organization, working memory, and impulse control. By 5 years of age, her cognitive abilities were equivalent to those of a 3.5-year-old. Screening for autism spectrum disorder was negative. At 8 years of age, she was studying at an academic level two years below her chronological age.

At 16 years of age, she demonstrated independence in managing daily tasks, including using public transportation and completing household chores, and actively participated in sports.","FKM","PQBP1","Yes","RENPENNING SYNDROME","309500","3242","PMID: 31840929 DOI: 10.1002/ajmg.a.61451",,,,
534,"a 24-year-old male, presented with concerns regarding inadequate weight gain. Despite a good appetite, poor growth had been noted since early childhood. He was born at term at home, but details regarding birth measurements and early treatment were unavailable. At birth, he experienced a delay in passing meconium, leading to the discovery of an imperforate anus, which was surgically corrected. Apart from an episode of gastroenteritis at five years of age, his childhood was otherwise uneventful. His parents recalled a mild developmental delay compared to his siblings. At seven years of age, he was enrolled in school but dropped out after a month due to bullying and did not receive further formal education. At the time of presentation, he was employed as a farmer and cattle tender. While he could perform basic self-care tasks and use a mobile phone, he was unable to perform simple calculations and was perceived as a “simpleton” in his village. No formal IQ assessment had been conducted.

On examination, his weight was 35 kg (−4 SD), height was 155 cm (−3 SD), and head circumference was 47 cm (−5 SD), with a body mass index of 14.58. He had a lean build with reduced subcutaneous fat. His facial features included a long, narrow face, deep-set eyes, closely spaced eyes, and underdeveloped cheekbones. His nose was prominent with a convex nasal ridge, and his ears were protruding. Notable musculoskeletal findings included upper back muscle atrophy, loss of cervical spine curvature, winging of the scapulae, and mild thoracic scoliosis with a leftward curvature. His thoracic cavity appeared narrowed in the anteroposterior dimension. Despite these findings, he did not exhibit limb girdle weakness. His digits were long and slender, with prominent joints. A constriction was noted at the base of both fourth fingers. Additional limb findings included sandal gaps and a second toe longer than the great toe. Although the joints, particularly in the hands and feet, appeared prominent, there was no restriction in movement. His speech had a nasal twang but remained comprehensible. Systemic examination was unremarkable.

Laboratory investigations revealed mild microcytic hypochromic anemia (Hb = 11.1 g/dL), while liver and kidney function tests, lipid profile, glucose levels, and creatine phosphokinase were within normal limits. Ophthalmologic evaluation did not reveal any abnormalities. Radiographs, except for the absence of the normal cervical curve, were unremarkable. Ultrasonography of the kidneys showed mild increased echogenicity of the renal parenchyma. Echocardiography was not performed, but there were no clinical indications of cardiac pathology.

The proband was one of ten siblings born to nonconsanguineous parents. At the time of evaluation, he had one surviving brother and two sisters who were reportedly healthy. Two elder brothers had died due to severe diarrhea, and three other siblings died in the neonatal period from undetermined causes. Another brother, who was also born with an imperforate anus, died at 15 days of life. His mother had normal cognitive function. However, several male relatives from the maternal lineage had a history of subnormal intelligence, although they were not available for evaluation. According to family history, some of these individuals had a similarly lean build, while others had a typical physical appearance.

Genetic analysis revealed a hemizygous deletion (c.459_462delAGAG) in Exon 4 of PQBP1, a pathogenic variant that results in a frameshift (p.R153Sfs*41) and premature termination of translation. Sanger sequencing confirmed maternal inheritance of this variant, which was absent in the unaffected brother. This particular variant has been previously reported and is the most commonly documented mutation in affected individuals. It is absent from population databases and predicted to be disease-causing by in silico analysis.

The observed features in the proband align with previously reported cases, including a lean body mass, loss of cervical and upper thoracic curvature, and winged scapulae, likely due to muscle atrophy. These features are consistently described in affected individuals and may serve as useful diagnostic markers. Additionally, a sandal gap was noted in this patient, a feature not commonly reported. The phenotypic characteristics appear to be recognizable across different ethnic backgrounds, as evidenced by similar reports in various populations. While most pathogenic variants are truncating mutations, genotype-phenotype correlations remain inconsistent.","FKM","PQBP1","Yes","RENPENNING SYNDROME","309500","3242","PMID: 31840915 DOI: 10.1002/ajmg.a.61457",,,,
535,"A 9-year-old boy, born to non-consanguineous parents, presented with developmental delay and characteristics suggestive of a neurodevelopmental condition. His antenatal and perinatal history were unremarkable. He exhibited globally delayed early developmental milestones and currently has borderline intellectual disability.

Anthropometric measurements revealed a height of 114 cm (Z score < -3) and a weight of 23 kg (-1 to -2 Z score). His head circumference was measured at 47 cm. No other significant medical or surgical history was noted. He is the only child in the family, and no similar concerns were reported among other family members.

Upon physical examination, he displayed distinctive facial features, including a small head size, a narrow and tall face, upslanting palpebral fissures, a bulbous nose tip, and cupped ears. A systemic examination, including a neurological assessment, yielded normal findings. These observations pointed toward a syndromic cause. Brain magnetic resonance imaging and an echocardiogram were unremarkable.

Genetic testing via clinical exome sequencing identified a pathogenic hemizygous deletion in exon 5 of the polyglutamine tract-binding protein-1 (PQBP1) gene, specifically c.459_462del (p.Arg153SerfsTer41). This variant has been previously documented in affected individuals and classified as pathogenic in the ClinVar database. Computational analysis using MutationTaster2 predicted this variant to be damaging. The reference region is evolutionarily conserved. This mutation resulted in a frameshift and premature termination of the protein 41 amino acids downstream of codon 153, confirming the diagnosis.

This condition is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by mutations in the PQBP1 gene, with fewer than 80 cases reported in the literature since 1962. The PQBP1 gene encodes a nuclear protein involved in pre-mRNA splicing and transcription regulation. The characteristic features include intellectual disability, short stature, small head size, and distinctive facial features such as a long, triangular face, upslanting eyes, a bulbous nasal tip, an overhanging columella, a short philtrum, and cupped ears. Affected individuals tend to have a thin build. Being X-linked, the condition primarily affects males, though a single case in a female has been documented.

Additional findings in some patients include congenital heart anomalies, muscular atrophy affecting the paraspinal muscles, cleft palate, anal malformations, and coloboma, with these features occurring in about 20% of cases. The patient in this case did not exhibit any cardiac defects or loss of cervical and thoracic spine curvature. Global developmental delay is present in approximately two-thirds of affected individuals and typically progresses to moderate to severe intellectual disability.

Several phenotypic variations associated with mutations in the PQBP1 gene have been described, including conditions such as Golabi-Ito-Hall syndrome, Hamel cerebro-palato-cardiac syndrome, Sutherland-Haan syndrome, Porteous syndrome, MRX55, and three other X-linked intellectual disability families, which are collectively categorized under this syndrome. Among these, Hamel cerebro-palato-cardiac syndrome represents the most severe phenotype.

A key differential diagnosis is fragile X syndrome, which shares overlapping craniofacial features such as elongated facial structure, protruding ears, intellectual disability, and behavioral symptoms. However, a distinguishing feature is that the present case involves a smaller head size, whereas fragile X syndrome is characterized by normal or large head circumference. Additionally, the presence of enlarged testes, a hallmark of fragile X syndrome, is not observed in this condition. Other possible causes of a small head size include fetal alcohol syndrome, congenital cytomegalovirus infection, maternal phenylketonuria, primary hereditary microcephaly, and Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome.

Management involves early intervention, including specialized education, speech and behavioral therapy, and addressing associated complications such as congenital heart defects or genitourinary anomalies if present. To date, only one adult case of this syndrome has been reported in India. This report represents the first documented case in a child from the Indian population. It underscores the significance of recognizing specific facial characteristics in children presenting with autism-related symptoms to achieve an accurate etiological diagnosis, which has crucial implications for prognosis and genetic counseling.","FKM","PQBP1","Yes","RENPENNING SYNDROME","309500","3242","PMID: 39779256 DOI: 10.4103/aian.aian_789_24",,,,
536,"Baby boy M. J. was born at 36 weeks' gestational age following a prenatal diagnosis of a chromosomal deletion. His mother, a 21-year-old gravida 2, para 1, had a previous miscarriage at approximately seven weeks' gestation. She denied exposure to alcohol, tobacco, x-rays, or teratogenic medications during pregnancy and reported taking prenatal vitamins. She received regular prenatal care, and the pregnancy remained relatively uncomplicated until a routine ultrasound at approximately 21 weeks' gestation revealed symmetrical intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), with fetal measurements aligning with approximately 19 weeks’ gestation. The anatomy was difficult to evaluate, prompting a referral to a Maternal-Fetal Medicine Center. A subsequent ultrasound at 24 weeks confirmed symmetrical IUGR, micrognathia, a single umbilical artery, and a potential cardiac defect. An amniocentesis was performed, along with additional testing for other syndromes, which returned normal results. Final chromosomal analysis confirmed an abnormal karyotype involving a deletion on chromosome 4.

Maternal prenatal laboratory results indicated blood type A positive, negative tests for syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis B, rubella immunity, and a positive group beta strep culture. A four-generation family history revealed a maternal aunt who died shortly after birth due to complications of a diaphragmatic hernia, a brother and maternal grandmother diagnosed with a cardiac conduction disorder, and a cousin with autism. Other family members had a history of multiple miscarriages, but no known genetic disorders were identified. The mother had mixed Eskimo, French-Canadian, German, English, and possibly Russian ancestry, while the father had German, English, and Mexican ancestry, with no reported consanguinity.

M. J. was delivered vaginally following spontaneous labor. His mother experienced premature rupture of membranes for 16 hours before delivery and received antibiotic therapy. The infant was in vertex presentation but exhibited respiratory difficulties at birth. He was hypotonic and apneic, with Apgar scores of 3, 6, and 6 at 1, 5, and 10 minutes, respectively. His birth weight was 1.820 kg, head circumference 30 cm, and length 46 cm, confirming IUGR as all measurements were below the tenth percentile. At 28 minutes of life, he was intubated due to increasing respiratory distress. Thick secretions were noted, requiring frequent suctioning. He had pale skin and diminished tone but improved breathing efforts following intubation. He was directly admitted to the level III neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).

Upon NICU admission, M. J. was placed on a radiant warmer and conventional ventilator with 50% oxygen. A low-lying umbilical venous catheter was placed, though umbilical arterial catheter placement was unsuccessful. He received a normal saline bolus due to poor perfusion. His chest x-ray findings did not indicate respiratory distress syndrome, and surfactant was not required. Vital signs remained within normal limits for his gestational age. Despite appearing alert, he exhibited significantly low muscle tone and responded to tactile stimulation. His anterior fontanel was soft and flat with overriding sutures. He had micrognathia, a small oral cavity, a deviated airway, a flattened nasal bridge, a high forehead, low-set ears, and abnormal ear helices. He showed mild to moderate intercostal and substernal retractions but had a regular heart rate and rhythm without murmur. His pulses were equal, and his capillary refill time was slightly prolonged. Abdominal examination showed normal bowel sounds with no hepatosplenomegaly, though a two-vessel umbilical cord was noted. Genital findings included micropenis (1 cm), hypospadias with a midshaft urethral opening, and high-positioned but present testes. His skin was pale but well-perfused, with occasional petechiae. He was placed on early total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

On day two of life, after achieving cardiovascular stability, trophic feedings with expressed breast milk were initiated. However, he developed bilious aspirates, prompting discontinuation of enteral feeding. Despite remaining NPO, he continued to have persistent bilious drainage, totaling 71 mL over 24 hours. Fluid losses were replaced with normal saline containing potassium chloride, and TPN with intralipids was continued. Abdominal imaging revealed a gasless lower abdomen. By day four, an upper gastrointestinal study confirmed an obstruction at the proximal jejunum. Surgical intervention revealed multiple small areas of atretic bowel, requiring four anastomoses. Postoperative care included antibiotic therapy, pain management with fentanyl, and placement of a gastric suction tube. Hyperbilirubinemia was noted on day three, and phototherapy was initiated.

A few days after surgery, M. J. was extubated to high-flow nasal cannula therapy and remained stable. Trophic feedings were cautiously reintroduced once bilious gastric output ceased. Due to his medical condition, he required close monitoring for potential intestinal obstruction. At 20 days of life, he remained in the NICU. His diagnoses included increased risk for developmental delay due to genetic factors, hypospadias, IUGR, congenital micrognathia, micropenis, gastrointestinal obstruction, hyperbilirubinemia, prematurity, respiratory distress, and the need for psychosocial intervention, as his parents had expressed interest in placing him for adoption before delivery.","FKM","IC","Yes","WOLF-HIRSCHHORN SYNDROME","194190","280","PMID: 25137600 DOI: 10.1097/ANC.0000000000000116",,,,
537,"A 13-year-old boy, the first child of a young, unrelated, and apparently healthy couple, with no similar cases reported in the family. The pregnancy progressed without complications. However, a fetal ultrasound scan conducted at 36 weeks of gestation revealed an absence of the corpus callosum. The child was born at full term via cesarean section, with a birth weight of 3600 g, a length of 52 cm, an occipital-frontal circumference of 36.5 cm, and an Apgar score of 8.

Postnatal development was significantly delayed. The child raised his head at 18 months, sat without support at 2 years, and had not developed speech by the age of 13 years. Additionally, he experienced recurrent respiratory infections.

At 13 years and 7 months, a physical evaluation showed growth parameters below the expected range for his age (weight: −0.89 standard deviation (SD), height: −2.39 SD, occipital-frontal circumference: −1.23 SD). Dysmorphic facial features were noted, along with defects of the lacrimal system and a small palate abnormality. Other findings included a protruding chest wall, separation of abdominal muscles, hypospadias, undescended testes, a sacral sinus, delayed tooth eruption, spastic quadriplegia/tetraparesis, and severe intellectual disability.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the absence of the corpus callosum, along with mild dilatation of the ventricular system. Additional malformations included a cardiac defect (atrial septal defect) and bilateral optic atrophy.

559,"This 18-year-old young man is the second child of healthy, unrelated parents, with an older sister who is unaffected. His medical history began in early pregnancy with the detection of a cystic hygroma measuring 8 mm in the first trimester. Karyotype analysis on amniotic fluid cells confirmed a 46,XY chromosomal formula. At 21 weeks of gestation, an ultrasound examination revealed a left pyelic dilation of 9 mm, which later increased to 22 mm with a loss of corticomedullary differentiation. Additionally, intestinal hyperechogenicity was observed, prompting genetic testing of both parents for CFTR mutations, which returned negative results.

The patient was delivered spontaneously at 38 weeks of gestation, with a birth weight of 3620 g (+1 standard deviation [SD]), a length of 50 cm (within the average growth curve), and a head circumference of 35 cm (-1 SD) (French standard growth curve referenced). At birth, physical examination noted excessive neck skin, low-set ears with thick lobules, a broad and depressed nasal root, marked hypertelorism, down-slanting palpebral fissures, a narrow thorax, and bilateral clinodactyly of the fifth fingers. A bilateral renal bifidity was identified, and a left superior polar nephrectomy was performed at six years of age. His mother passed away from a brain tumor when he was one year old.

Ophthalmologic examination revealed bilateral papillary dystrophy, though iris coloboma was absent. Psychomotor development was mildly delayed. Based on the initial clinical presentation, Noonan syndrome was suspected, but molecular analysis of the PTPN11 gene was negative. At four years of age, a different diagnosis was proposed, which was later confirmed through genetic testing, identifying a de novo heterozygous pathogenic variant: c.224T>C; p.ILE75THR in the ACTB gene (NM_001101.5) [OMIM 102630; 243310].

Despite the recommendation for specialized education, he attended a regular school with the support of an educational assistant and is currently enrolled in a horticulture boarding school. His father, a farmer managing his own agricultural enterprise, has influenced his interests, and he actively participates in familial agricultural activities.

Due to the family's reluctance to engage in regular medical follow-ups, he was lost to follow-up during late childhood and adolescence. His growth curve remained within normal ranges, and at the last recorded examination, his weight was 73 kg, height 185 cm, and head circumference 61 cm.

His recent medical history began at the age of 18 with progressive episodes of disorientation, apathy, and drooling over six months, culminating in acute abdominal pain and nausea that led to an emergency room visit. Viral gastroenteritis was suspected but not confirmed, and symptomatic treatment with oral metoclopramide was administered. A few days later, he developed an acute catatonic syndrome characterized by marked stiffness of all four limbs, difficulties in walking despite not being completely immobile, akinesia, and dysarthria, necessitating hospitalization in pediatric neurology.

Brain MRI, PET scan, and DAT scan were performed, all returning normal findings, except for dilated Virchow-Robin spaces, which are a frequent feature in his condition. Treatment with tropatepine chlorhydrate led to improvement in catatonia, restoring his ability to walk independently. However, persistent bradykinesia and upper limb rigidity prompted the initiation of dopaminergic therapy with progressive doses of levodopa-carbidopa. Gradual improvement followed, but akinesia and apragmatism persisted, accompanied by marked apathy. Psychiatric evaluation confirmed a major depressive episode, raising questions regarding the interplay between the extrapyramidal symptoms and the identified genetic mutation.

Currently, the patient is under joint care by neurologists, physical and rehabilitation medicine specialists, and child psychiatrists. With regular psychiatric follow-up, the major depressive symptoms have regressed, and neurological examination has nearly normalized, allowing discontinuation of dopaminergic therapy. Only a mild hypertonia of the upper right limb remains.","FKM","ACTB","Yes","BARAITSER-WINTER SYNDROME ","243310","2995","PMID: 35803559 DOI: 10.1016/j.ejmg.2022.104559",,,,
560,"The first patient, a 37-year-old woman, was evaluated at a genetics clinic at 25 years of age due to intellectual disability and distinct facial features. She had a history of right congenital hip dislocation, which required surgery at 2 years of age, and later underwent a right hip replacement at 32 years of age. Her early developmental milestones were delayed; her caretaker sister recalled that she first walked at 5–6 years and achieved toilet training at 8 years of age. She continues to require assistance with personal hygiene.

She is capable of communicating in sentences, answering questions, and following simple commands. However, she occasionally misuses words, repeats words, or speaks to herself. She can recognize some letters and numbers but does not maintain consistent eye contact. Her behavior includes hyperactivity, episodes of screaming, tantrums, and excessive friendliness towards strangers. She has been diagnosed with mild to moderate intellectual disability and attends an adult day program. She resides with her sister and receives support from two additional caregivers. She enjoys music and dancing.

Medical concerns include a sleep disorder managed with melatonin, a refractive error corrected with visual aids, urinary incontinence, minimal mitral valve prolapse, and cardiomegaly. She takes medications for anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder and is under psychiatric care. Notably, she has never experienced seizures, hearing loss, or colobomas on eye examination.

On clinical examination, her speech was slow with mild dysarthria, and she exhibited a labile affect. Her weight was 65.8 kg (75th–90th percentile), height was 156.5 cm (10th–25th percentile), and occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) was 52.2 cm (3rd percentile). A 1 cm patch of alopecia was present on the temporal region of the scalp. She displayed mild brachycephaly with thick, curly hair, a long face with a high anterior hairline and a small widow’s peak, and neutral palpebral fissures. Her eyes appeared widely spaced, with an interpupillary distance (IPD) of 5.8 cm (50th–75th percentile). The nose had a slightly bulbous tip, and she exhibited a short columella, thin upper lip, and small chin. Her ears had overfolded helices and measured 6.5 cm (+1 to +2 standard deviations). She had long fingers and thumbs, with a single palmar crease on her right hand. Her feet were narrow with hallux valgus.

He never attended school and is unable to read or write. His caretaker described him as having a happy demeanor with no behavioral challenges. He participates in an adult day program for six hours per day.

Medical history includes hypercholesterolemia, but otherwise, his general health is unremarkable. There is no history of seizures, visual impairment, or hearing loss.

594,"A 23-year-old male with no known comorbidities presented to the nephrology department with complaints of intermittent episodes of milky white urine and edematous illness persisting for the past seven years. Additionally, he reported dysuria, hesitancy, and incomplete voiding of urine for the past three years, along with episodes of fever. Two years ago, he experienced a single episode of gross hematuria. He mentioned that filariasis is endemic in his native region. There was no history of rash, oliguria, allergies, or drug intake.  

On examination, his blood pressure was 130/80 mm Hg, and his pulse rate was 80/min. Edema was present, but the rest of the systemic examination findings were unremarkable. The patient underwent a diagnostic workup for lower urinary tract symptoms and milky white urine. Urinalysis revealed mild proteinuria (1+), absence of red blood cells, and 3–4 white blood cells per high-power field. Urine fat/chyle was positive, while hypercalciuria and hyperphosphaturia were absent. A 24-hour urine protein analysis showed a level of 2.08 g. Serum creatinine was 0.8 gm/dL. Lipid profile results were within normal limits, with triglycerides at 152 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol at 40 mg/dL, VLDL cholesterol at 30.4 mg/dL, and total cholesterol at 130.6 mg/dL. Hematological parameters were within normal limits (Hb: 13.1 gm/dL, TLC: 8.3 × 1000/uL, platelet count: 226 × 1000/mm³). There was no evidence of peripheral eosinophilia (N65 L30 E2 M3).  

Given the lower urinary tract symptoms, an evaluation for genitourinary tuberculosis was conducted. Urine microscopy and cultures for bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial pathogens were negative.  

The differential diagnoses considered included focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and IgA nephropathy, based on the presence of subnephrotic proteinuria, normal serum creatinine, and bland urinary sediment findings. The patient was empirically started on diethylcarbamazine (DEC), and a renal biopsy was performed. The biopsy sample contained six glomeruli, one of which was globally sclerosed. The remaining five viable glomeruli appeared enlarged with hypertrophic visceral epithelial cells (podocytes) exhibiting a vacuolated foamy appearance. Tubular structures showed minimal atrophy, and the interstitium exhibited minimal fibrosis along with a sparse lymphomononuclear infiltrate containing aggregates of foam cells. Blood vessels appeared largely unremarkable. No microfilarial parasites were identified.  

Direct immunofluorescence analysis, performed on 13 glomeruli, did not reveal any immune deposits. Electron microscopy demonstrated numerous electron-dense lamellated structures, described as myelin figures or zebra bodies, within the cytoplasm of podocytes and endothelial cells. Similar myelin figures were also observed in the peritubular capillaries and tubular epithelial cells.","FKM","GLA","Yes","FABRY DISEASE

595,"A 24-year-old male presented to the nephrology department for evaluation of protein loss in the urine, which was below the nephrotic range, along with bland urinary sediments. He had experienced an illness characterized by body swelling 11 years ago, for which he was prescribed steroids at a suboptimal dose. He did not report any history of blood in the urine, painful urination, fever, skin rash, reduced urine output, allergies, or medication use.

On examination, he was found to be swollen and anemic, with a blood pressure of 140/80 mm Hg. The remainder of the systemic examination was unremarkable.

Urine analysis revealed moderate protein loss (2+) without red or white blood cells. A 24-hour urine protein measurement was 1.41 g, and serum creatinine was 1.3 g/dL. His lipid profile was within the normal range, with triglycerides at 65 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol at 34 mg/dL, VLDL cholesterol at 13.0 mg/dL, and total cholesterol at 181 mg/dL. Hematological parameters were normal, with a hemoglobin level of 10.1 g/dL, a total leukocyte count of 6.45 × 1000/uL, and a platelet count of 161 × 1000/mm³. No peripheral eosinophilia was observed, with differential counts showing neutrophils at 45%, lymphocytes at 34%, eosinophils at 6%, and monocytes at 7%.

The primary conditions considered as possible diagnoses were focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and a form of immune-mediated kidney disease affecting the glomeruli. A kidney biopsy was performed, which included 15 glomeruli, four of which were completely sclerosed, and one showed segmental scarring. The remaining glomeruli were enlarged, displaying mild expansion of the mesangial region. The cells lining the glomerular capillary loops were swollen, appearing foamy with numerous fine vacuoles within their cytoplasm. Similar vacuolation was seen in the cells of the distal tubules and the surrounding kidney tissue. There were also areas of mild tubular shrinkage and fibrosis in the kidney interstitium. The blood vessels showed mild thickening of the inner layer.

Direct immunofluorescence of 10 glomeruli demonstrated coarse granular deposits of C3 (3+) along the glomerular capillary walls and within the mesangial region. No deposits were observed for IgG, IgM, IgA, or C1q.

Though the antenatal period was uncomplicated, the child had a low birth weight (2.2 kg, <−3SD) and evidence of symmetrical intrauterine growth retardation (OFC - 33 cm/ <5th centile, length – 46 cm/ (−2) - (−3) SD). He had recurrent vomiting since two months of age, associated with poor weight gain.




The clinical course was complicated with recurrent seizures since three months, and the child exhibited developmental regression with poor visual fixation and loss of social smile. He had remittent fever for several months with repeatedly negative septic screens. Later in the clinical course, he developed marked dystonia and dyskinetic movements, suggesting extrapyramidal nervous system involvement. His elder sibling had similar symptoms, including developmental regression and epileptic encephalopathy, and passed away at 1½ years of age due to aspiration pneumonia.","Farid Zare","GCH1","No","GTP cyclohydrolase 1 deficiency","233910","2102","PMID: 31202265",,,,
605,"The 23-year-old woman has had a history of gait abnormality and dystonia since she was 15. Foot clawing was more pronounced on her left side. In addition, she complained of weariness in her left foot, or some indescribable discomfort, which would appear 1 h after waking up in the morning and would become aggravated at bedtime around 11:00 p.m. The symptoms would interfere with her running or walking. The foot clawing would be relieved for about 1 h from waking. The aforementioned symptoms would disrupt her normal sleep, and she would have to put her soles against bedplate to control the foot clawing at bedtime. These clinical features intensified during the 2 years prior to her visit to our clinic. Neurological examination revealed that she had intact cranial nerve functioning, full muscle strength, no pathological reflex, and no cerebellar dysfunction. No bradykinesia, rigidity, or tremor was observed. Bilateral foot dystonia was detected and was more pronounced on her left side.

She was frequently hospitalized for tachypnea and developed hepatosplenomegaly in next 5 months. Multiple treatment modalities were tried including antibiotics, nebulisations, anti-fungal agents, systemic corticosteroids and moist oxygen inhalation. In spite of all these, child remained tachypneic and continued to be oxygen dependent.

Her chest radiogram showed hazy, diffuse bilateral alveolar infiltrates. HRCT showed ground glass opacification of the right upper lobe, suggestive of alveolar proteinosis. Lung biopsy with PAS staining showed dilated alveoli, lined by type-2 pneumocytes, containing foamy macrophages further indicating alveolar proteinosis. Possibility of a secondary alveolar proteinosis was kept in view of hepatosplenomegaly along with lung involvement. Liver biopsy showed fairly well preserved lobular architecture and cord pattern, few lymphocytes in portal tract and finely vacuolated ballooned hepatocytes and kupffer cell were suggestive of Niemann-Pick disease.

621,"The patient was a 13-year-old female who was born after an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. Perinatal history was negative, and psychomotor development was normal. Her parents are non-consanguineous and of Ukrainian origin. Her brother died at 10 years of age from an unspecified neurodegenerative disease lasting approximately 2 years; the remaining family history was negative. No neonatal liver disease or prolonged jaundice was noticed.




At 12 years of age, the patient was referred to the authors’ attention because of epilepsy, dysphagia, school difficulties, and regression of speech, which had started 4 to 5 months before the authors’ visit. At neurological examination, the patient had cerebellar ataxia, dysmetria, intentional tremor, dysdiadochokinesia, and clumsiness. Dystonia, dysarthria, dysphonia, facial diplegia, and mild drooling were also present, and mild pyramidal signs were noted in the lower limbs. The patient was fatigued, presented with an emaciated status, and had no organomegaly.




Laboratory tests performed at the first examination and during clinical follow-up were all within normal limits—including routine hematology, electrolytes, liver enzymes, renal function, coagulation profile, amylase, creatine kinase, glycemia, immunoglobulin, amino acids, albumin, ammonium, arterial blood gas analysis, vitamin B12, ceruloplasmin level and serum copper level, apolipoprotein and lipid profile, alpha-fetoprotein, lactate, cerebrospinal fluid (protein, cells, glucose, neurotransmitters, culture, and lactate), and urinalysis. Normal results were also obtained from metabolic investigations of plasmatic amino acids, urinary organic acids, very long fatty acids, hexosaminidases A and B, β-galactocerebrosidase, palmitoyl-protein thioesterase, tripeptidyl peptidase 1, and arylsulfatase A.




Electroencephalography showed abnormal background activity with multifocal epileptiform potentials. Brain magnetic resonance showed diffuse brain atrophy with abnormal periventricular white matter signal and mild ventricular dilatation. Cerebellar vermis atrophy was detected. Cerebral magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging revealed neuronal loss with reactive gliosis. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging was normal. Muscle and skin biopsies were normal, and no features of mitochondrial or storage disorders were found by assessing enzyme histochemistry. No abnormal findings were shown by sensory and motor nerve conduction studies, visual evoked potentials, auditory brainstem-evoked potentials, fundus oculi examination, abdominal echography, and chest radiograph.

The AGPAR score was 10 both at 1 min and 5 min, and the newborn screening results were normal. The parents are unrelated, and the 6-year-old brother is healthy. Parents reported abnormal abrupt movements of the child after birth that stopped spontaneously.
Biologically, at 9 months of age, elevated transaminases TGO = 50 UI/ L, TGP = 51 [normal values 10–35 UI/ L] and normal coagulation parameters with ATIIIA = 63% [normal values 80–120%] and FXI 53% at the lower limit [normal values 50–150%] were assayed. The cytology and the thyroid function were normal.

The clinical examination at 9 months of age revealed ataxia, hypotonia, hyperlaxity, strabismus, esotropia, feeding difficulties, and inverted nipples. The child was calm and exclusively breastfed with an absence of facial dysmorphia and no sleeping disorders. At that time, the girl presented an inability to reach a seated posture. The diagnosis of CDG was oriented by an abnormal pattern in serum transferrin isoelectrofocusing [8] with an elevation of asialo- and disialo-transferrin, typical from a type I CDG (Fig. 1).

623,"A Czech boy was born as the first child of unrelated parents. He was diagnosed with hemodynamically insignificant pericardial effusion in the 22nd week of pregnancy. Amniocentesis was performed with no evidence of aneuploidy. Routine testing of the mother for toxoplasmosis, parvovirus B19, CMV, and HSV infections was negative. Family history was unremarkable.




Labor was induced at 40 weeks of pregnancy for intrauterine growth retardation and oligohydramnios. Delivery was by forceps-assisted vaginal delivery due to fetal heart rate deceleration. The boy’s birth weight was 2390 g (z-score = −1.83), length of 48 cm, and occipital frontal circumference 34 cm. His postnatal adaptation was normal, but he was noted to be highly dysmorphic. Initially, due to swallowing difficulties, a nasogastric tube was used for feeding.


At the age of 4 weeks pericardial effusion further progressed and the boy was referred to our department for complex evaluation and assessment. At this time, we observed a notable psychomotor retardation, significant central hypotonia, limited spontaneous movement, poor eye contact, no reaction on noise, significant failure to thrive (with only 90 g gain in 2 weeks). Arthrogenic contractures limiting the range of joins mobility were observed mainly in knee joints, ankle joints and elbow joints. His dysmorphic features included dolichocephaly, bossing forehead, dysmorphic low set ears (Figure 1A), enlarged fontanelle, wider philtrum, broad nasal root, prominent nares, hypertelorism, retrognathia (Figure 1B), inverted nipples (Figure 1C), abnormal fat distribution over his thighs, buttocks and suprapubic regions (Figure 1D,E), pilonidal sinus and hammertoes (Figure 1F).","Farid Zare","PMM2","Yes","PMM2-CDG","212065","79318","PMID: 33133147",,,,
624,"A 9-year-old Saudi boy was referred for evaluation of psychomotor retardation, hypotonia, and cardiac abnormalities. He was born at 40 weeks gestation after a normal pregnancy and delivery, with a birth weight of 4.6 kg. Hypotonia without feeding problems was noted in the neonatal period, bilateral alternating squint at two months of age, and hypokinesia at four months of age.




At one year of age, he developed febrile seizures followed by afebrile partial epilepsy that responded well to carbamazepine. At three years of age, he presented with recurrent episodes of difficulty breathing and fatigability. Chest X-ray revealed cardiac enlargement with increased pulmonary vascularity. Echocardiography showed moderate dilatation and dysfunction of the left ventricle (LV). The end-systolic LV dimension was 3 (1.7-2.5 cm) corresponding to a Z-score of 4.3, while the end-diastolic LV dimension was 4.2 (2.9-3.9 cm) and the Z-score was 3.4. The ejection fraction and ejection fraction shortening were slightly subnormal at 56% and 27%, respectively. The interventricular septum thickness was normal. There was no mitral regurgitation and no pericardial effusion. These findings confirmed moderate cardiac dysfunction. He was subsequently placed on captopril at a dose of 6.25 mg three times daily, which was continued for five years. Captopril was just recently weaned off with stabilization of the cardiac function.




At the age of 6 years, he was not able to sit unsupported, was nonverbal, and was completely dependent on the family for care. On physical examination at the age of 7 years, the child was wheelchair-bound with severe intellectual disability and no speech. His head circumference and weight were on the 50th centile. His height was on the 25th centile. He had brachycephaly, bilateral esotropia, coarse hair with a double hair whorl, low anterior hairline, broad nasal bridge, widely spaced eyes, prominent large ears, short philtrum, wide mouth with a thin upper lip, small teeth, widely spaced inverted nipples, bilateral cryptorchidism, reduced muscle bulk and tone with axial hypotonia. Deep tendon reflexes were difficult to elicit. Finger joints were hyperextensible, but knees and hips showed limited joint extension.




Routine laboratory investigations showed normal urinalysis, normal complete blood count, blood glucose, thyroid and kidney function tests, serum amino acids, lactate, acylcarnitine profile, and urine organic acids. Serum GOT was 37 (17-59 U/L), GPT 24 (21-72 U/L). Cholesterol and clotting factor XI were not available. CSF examination was normal for cells, protein, glucose, and lactate.

She was born with a smaller-than-average occipitofrontal circumference (OFC 30.5 cm, <first percentile) and remained below the normal range with an OFC of 43.2 cm (first percentile) at the 18-month follow-up. There is a distant family history of epilepsy but otherwise no known neurological disease or developmental delay.She presented at 6 months old for a first-time seizure, described as focal tonic that self-resolved. Her initial interictal routine EEG at the time demonstrated age-appropriate organization but was notable for frequent left posterior spikes and sharp waves (Figure 1), prompting initiation of levetiracetam. At the time of presentation, parents noted difficulties at 3 months of age due to delay in endogenous smile, but no other delays. 
Within 2 days, she developed frequent clinical seizures. Continuous EEG captured multiple electroclinical seizures beginning with background attenuation, followed by rhythmic theta frequency, with shifting laterality. The seizure would then build in amplitude, slowing to 4 Hz and spreading biposteriorly as sharply contoured waves. These seizures prompted rapid titration of levetiracetam, fosphenytoin and lacosamide. At this time, her background on EEG continued to be normal. Approximately 4 weeks after initial presentation, she deteriorated clinically. Her interictal EEG had nearly continuous polyspike and spike wave discharges involving both occipital regions, lack of organization, and disappearance of posterior-dominant rhythm indicating an epileptic encephalopathy. She had 3 separate stereotyped electrographic seizures (1) bi-occipital fast polyspikes spreading temporally with better evolution on the right, (2) left centro-temporal 8 Hz activity spreading to the right centro-temporal areas, and (3) focal right occipital fast polyspikes that evolved in amplitude and frequency (Figure 1). After initiation of phenobarbital, there was a dramatic electroclinical improvement.

626,"A 17-year-old Chinese girl was admitted to the Department of Psychiatry at the Second Xiangya Hospital in August 2022 with manifestations of apathy, language reduction, and substupor. Her parents reported that the above symptoms had emerged approximately four years previously. According to her parents’ descriptions, at the onset of these symptoms, she once complained that she was afraid of school but refused to further explain the reason. She complained of several episodes of simple auditory hallucinations. In class, her teacher found her eyes glazed over, and she seemed to have trouble concentrating. She was spotted a few times exhibiting odd behaviors (public urination and inappropriate smiling) or speaking to herself using incomprehensible words.




Her parents first took her to the local psychiatry and neurology clinic in February 2019. At the clinic, she underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ambulatory electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring, which showed no abnormalities. Intelligence testing revealed an intelligence quotient of 70. She was prescribed medication for approximately 8 weeks. Although the odd behaviors and auditory hallucinations disappeared, her parents thought that her responses and activity levels were slower. They also worried about possible side effects; hence, they reduced the medication dosage, which was maintained until the patient was referred to our hospital. During this period, her apathy and substupor symptoms did not improve, and she had to stay home from school.


After admission, the patient seemed unwilling to interact with others. She always lowered her head and remained silent throughout the day. Talking to her was usually met with no response, and she only occasionally used a few words or nodded (or shook) her head to respond to the clinician’s inquiry.

She reported worsening pain despite ongoing pharmacological treatment and recent confirmation of a connective tissue disorder. The pain predominantly affected her knees, hands, wrists, and shoulders, with higher intensity during activity. Pain was measured using a visual analog scale (VAS), ranging from 4–5 cm at rest to 7–8 cm on activity. Daily activities such as walking and folding laundry exacerbated her symptoms, and she experienced morning stiffness. Her history included joint hypermobility since childhood, unexplained bruising, and previous musculoskeletal injuries, including fractures and a nerve surgery. She expressed fear of movement-related injury, which hindered her compliance with prescribed exercises. Psychological assessment revealed no significant anxiety or depressive symptoms. She was using long-acting tramadol and celecoxib but experienced only partial relief. A multidisciplinary team involving a pain physician, nurse, psychologist, and kinesiologist developed a treatment plan that included initiating nortriptyline, education on pacing and body mechanics, kinesio-taping for joint support, and a graded exercise program.

650,"The proband (P1) is a 12-year-old girl born to a non-consanguineous Italian couple, referred to our Center with suspected features of an overgrowth syndrome. Pregnancy was largely uneventful except for findings on prenatal imaging, which revealed a dysplastic multicystic right kidney and femur length at the upper limits. She was delivered at term (40 weeks gestation) with a birth weight of 3.250 kg (50–75th centile) and length of 52 cm (50th centile). In early infancy, her length exceeded the 97th centile, and the dysplastic kidney gradually atrophied. Thyroid and pelvic ultrasound scans were normal. A carpal x-ray revealed bone age advanced by 4 years over her chronological age. Spine x-ray showed left-convex lumbar rotoscoliosis with moderate compensatory right-convex curvature. Additional skeletal features included valgus knees and flat feet. At 10 years old, she was diagnosed with bilateral pantonal sensorineural hearing loss, and dental evaluation showed peg-shaped incisors.

At 12 years, her weight was 74.8 kg (+2.04 SD), height 185.5 cm (+4.35 SD), and occipitofrontal circumference was 52.2 cm (−0.95 SD), indicating relative microcephaly. Her BMI was 21.7 (+0.44 SD), and arm-span was 182 cm with a normal arm span-to-height ratio (0.98). Intellectual and social development were within normal limits. Mild dysmorphic features were noted, including a high frontal hairline, slightly asymmetric face, deeply set eyes, slight prognathism, small ears, bifid uvula, and peg-shaped incisors. Additional skeletal findings included long, thin fingers with prominent phalanx epiphyses, camptodactyly of fingers and toes, clinodactyly affecting several fingers, and proximal placement of the fifth toes. Mild joint hyperextensibility was present (Beighton score 5/9). Her skin showed no abnormalities such as striae distensae, bruising, atrophic scars, or pigmentation issues.

Her medical history includes a normal pregnancy and perinatal period, with birth at 38 weeks gestation. Her birth weight was 2.358 kg (5th percentile) and her length was 53 cm (97th percentile). Early childhood was unremarkable apart from the onset of multiple finger contractures at age 3, which progressively worsened. At age 4, she was diagnosed with an estimated 34% sensorineural hearing loss, which progressed to 58% by age 16. Hearing aids have been used since age 4. During childhood, she developed chronic joint pain in the hips and lower back. At age 6, an evaluation for her contractures concluded they might be post-traumatic, and surgical correction was attempted but unsuccessful. Scoliosis was also diagnosed. Brain MRI at age 12 showed no abnormalities.

Her physical, intellectual, and social development were normal. She sustained tibial stress fractures at ages 8 and 10, and underwent hip surgery for misalignment. At age 16, her height was 170 cm (90th percentile), weight 74.3 kg (90–95th percentile), and head circumference 52 cm (−2 SD). Physical examination revealed superficial telangiectasia over the nose, long and thin contracted fingers, mild scoliosis, genu valgum, and a 1.6 cm leg length discrepancy favoring the left leg. Imaging revealed right coxa valga with 30% uncovering of the femoral head and medial displacement of the left femoral head.

Her physical measurements are as follows: height of 1.66 m (between the 50th and 85th percentiles), weight of 60 kg, and body mass index (BMI) of 21.8 kg/m² (50-85th percentile). Her arm span measures 172 cm, which is 6 cm longer than her height, and her head circumference is 55 cm (+2 SD). Vital signs include a blood pressure of 110 × 72 mmHg and a heart rate of 93 beats per minute. She presents with mild dysmorphic facial features including a short forehead, bitemporal narrowing, upslanted palpebral fissures, microtia I, narrow palate, and retrognathia. Additional physical characteristics include marfanoid habitus, joint hyperflexibility, lumbar hyperlordosis, mild thoracic scoliosis, genu recurvatum, and dry skin on both arms. Thyroid function tests showed elevated serum levels of total T3 [220 ng/dL (RV 72–214 ng/dL)] and free T3 [0.39 ng/dL (RV 0.24–0.37 ng/dL)], decreased free T4 [0.9 ng/dL (RV 1.0–1.6 ng/dL)], and normal TSH [2.8 mUI/L (RV 0.50–4.9 mUI/L)]. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed no abnormalities.

Cytogenetic and molecular investigations revealed normal karyotypes in the patient and her parents. Whole-exome sequencing identified a rare de novo missense variant in **SLC16A2**: c.1388C > T:p.Pro463Leu (ENST00000587091), which was verified through Sanger sequencing and is not documented in gnomAD or ClinVar databases. Copy number variation (CNV) analysis showed no deletions or duplications in the **SLC16A2** gene. Computational analyses and functional studies suggest that this variant adversely impacts protein structure or function. The variant is classified as likely pathogenic in accordance with ACMG criteria (PS3, PM2, PM6, PP3). Haplotype analysis using a nearby SNP (rs5937843) demonstrated that the mutation occurred on the X chromosome inherited from the father.

X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) analysis using the HUMARA assay showed that 71% of the maternal allele and 29% of the paternal allele were inactive in the patient, indicating preferential inactivation of the normal allele.

653,"A 14-month-old male, firstborn to healthy, non-consanguineous parents of Haitian and Jamaican origin, was evaluated for failure to thrive and delayed developmental milestones. He was born full-term via spontaneous vaginal delivery without complications and experienced an unremarkable postnatal period. Concerns regarding abnormal reflexes and motor development were documented as early as two months of age, including hyperactive symmetric Moro reflex, excessive suck reflex, hypotonia in the upper extremities, hypertonia in the lower extremities, rhythmic limb movements, constant mouth opening, clenched toes, neck lag, and developmental delays.

At 11 months of age, he was referred to Children and Youth Services due to improper feeding, lack of follow-up, weight loss, and absence of parental support, leading to his placement in foster care. His nutritional intake was suboptimal, consisting of 10 ounces of whole milk and an unknown amount of pureed food twice daily. Despite being encouraged to consume 24 ounces of Pediasure and 6–8 ounces of pureed foods daily, concerns persisted regarding weight gain. His weight remained below the 1st percentile at multiple visits.

Initial laboratory workup revealed hypothyroidism with elevated TSH and low free T4 levels. Treatment with Synthroid led to transient improvement, but subsequent thyroid function tests showed elevated free T3 levels and low reverse T3, prompting discontinuation of Synthroid due to concerns about unregulated thyroid hormone metabolism. The child was transferred for further evaluation. On physical examination, he demonstrated bi-parietal narrowing, mild ptosis, ankle clonus, hypertonicity of all limbs, central muscle hypoplasia, and brisk reflexes. Repeat thyroid studies continued to show elevated free T3 and low reverse T3 levels. MRI of the brain demonstrated incomplete myelination, decreased white matter volume, and a thin corpus callosum with ex-vacuo prominence of ventricles, cisterns, and sulci.

Genomic analysis through the Cerebral Palsy Xpanded Panel identified a hemizygous X-linked mutation with two single-nucleotide variants in the **SLC16A2** gene. These included a guanine to alanine substitution at position 1 of intron 5 (IVS5+1 G>A) and at position 1400 of intron 1 (c.1400G>A).

By 4 months of age, he exhibited dolichocephaly, a small anterior fontanel, facial dysmorphism characterized by triangular facies, bushy eyebrows, depressed nasal bridge, horizontal palpebral fissures, short philtrum, arched palate, short neck, and left-sided cryptorchidism. There was evident neurodevelopmental delay with absent head control, trunk hypotonia, hypertonic limbs, hyperreflexia, and pyramidal signs. Additionally, he had a high-pitched cry and poor visual tracking without nystagmus. Over time, dystonic posturing and startle reactions to sensory stimuli developed. Initiation of levodopa (1 mg/kg/day) coincided with a worsening of movement disorders.

At 18 months of age, the child displayed axial and limb myoclonus, mild chorea, orolingual dyskinesias, irritability, and frequent crying while awake at rest. Biochemical investigations, including plasma amino acids, urine organic acids, acylcarnitine profile, and screening for specific neurotransmitter deficiencies, were unremarkable. Brain MRI at 5 months revealed delayed myelination. EEG showed background slowing without epileptiform discharges, though nonepileptic myoclonus was observed. Given the progressive worsening of abnormal movements, clonazepam (0.03 mg/kg/day) was introduced, leading to clinical improvement.

Whole exome sequencing revealed a pathogenic frameshift variant in **SLC16A2** (c.407dup), confirming the underlying diagnosis. Retrospective analysis identified symptoms indicative of thyroid dysfunction, including palmar and plantar hyperhidrosis, irritability, and heart rate fluctuations. Thyroid function tests showed normal TSH but elevated T3 and decreased T4L levels.

By 2 months of age, hypotonia and developmental delay were noted, with poor head control, absence of visual or auditory tracking, and paroxysmal episodes triggered by stimuli that included sudden facial flushing and tonic asymmetric posturing, though no epileptiform activity was detected. At 10 months, he developed dystonic posturing of all limbs and demonstrated a startle-like response, characterized by sound-triggered axial myoclonus during sleep.

By 4 years of age, while awake and at rest, the child presented with a dystonic posture in the upper limbs, more pronounced on the right side, accompanied by slight ipsilateral lateroretrocollis. Orofacial dyskinesias were observed, and he frequently displayed facial expressions suggesting pain and irritability. Physical examination revealed stunted growth, microcephaly (head circumference: 46 cm, <2 standard deviations, birth measurement unavailable), an elongated facial structure, high nasal root, guttural vocalizations, crying, drooling, dystonic quadriparesis, and hyperreflexia.

Electromyography, along with auditory and visual evoked potentials, yielded normal results.

By 24 months, the patient developed dystonia, a sound-triggered startle response, persistent trunk hypotonia, limb hypertonia, and hyperreflexia. A trial with l-dopa (1 mg/kg/day) was ineffective. Laboratory testing revealed TSH of 0.039 uUI/mL (reference: 0.7–5.97 uUI/mL) and T4 of 1.23 ng/dL (reference: 0.97–1.77 ng/dL), which led to levothyroxine supplementation (50 mcg/kg/day).

658,"a boy who presented to the hospital at 6 months of age due to motor retardation. Upon physical examination, his height (66.2 cm) and weight (8.2 kg) were within normal ranges. However, clinical findings included neck muscle weakness, limb hypertonia, head retroflexion, microcephaly (39.5 cm, <−2 SD), epilepsy, muscle hyperirritability, and poor motor coordination. T2-weighted MRI imaging revealed a low signal intensity in the left inferior and middle cerebellar peduncle, while no obvious abnormalities were observed in the posterior limbs of the internal capsules. Thyroid function tests showed abnormal levels: elevated T3 (5.78 nmol/L) and free T3 (15.72 nmol/L), along with decreased T4 (53.32 nmol/L) and free T4 (6.73 nmol/L).

Further familial assessment revealed that the patient’s mother had low T4 levels (3.49 pg/dl, normal range 5.00–13.00 pg/dl). Additionally, the proband’s elder brother exhibited similar but more severe symptoms, including microcephaly, epilepsy, profound intellectual disability, and severe cerebral palsy. His thyroid function was also abnormal with low T3 (2.78 nmol/L), low T4 (4.39 ug/dl), elevated free T3 (9.23 pmol/L), and borderline free T4 (12.02 pmol/L).

659,"A 14-month-old boy was referred to the Department of Developmental Behavior Pediatrics at Liuzhou Maternity and Child Healthcare Hospital, Guangxi province, for evaluation due to developmental delay, Achilles tendon contracture, hypertonia, nystagmus, and visual impairments. The child was born at full term following an uneventful pregnancy to non-consanguineous parents of Chinese descent, with no relevant medical history in the family. Birth parameters were within normal limits (52 cm and 3.3 kg), and by 17 April 2019, his measurements were 80 cm and 10.8 kg. Since birth, the boy had difficulty tracking light and objects, and nystagmus was noted early. Ophthalmological examination revealed exotropia, horizontal tremor of both eyes, absence of visual tracking, corneal transparency, and congenital cataracts. The father's ophthalmological evaluation was normal. The child exhibited significant developmental delays, including the inability to roll over until 12 months and sit unaided until 18 months. Physical examination revealed persistent hypertonia and Achilles tendon contracture. A Gesell developmental test indicated severe delay in adaptability and fine motor skills, moderate delay in gross motor skills, and mild delay in language and social skills. Brain MRI revealed delayed myelination and formation of a fifth ventricle. Karyotype analysis showed normal 46, XY, and tandem mass spectrometry did not indicate any metabolic disorders.

Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples of the patient and his parents. Targeted next-generation sequencing using an inherited disease panel was conducted. Sequencing data were aligned to the Human Reference Genome (hg19), and variants were analyzed using multiple bioinformatics platforms. A homozygous variant in the OPA1 gene (NM_015560: c.2189 T > C, p.Leu730Ser) was identified in the patient. This variant is not present in population databases and is predicted to be deleterious by multiple in-silico tools. Sanger sequencing confirmed that the patient's father was heterozygous for the variant, while the mother was wild-type. CNV analysis revealed a heterozygous deletion on chromosome 3 (3q28q29), confirmed by chromosomal microarray as a 3975 kb microdeletion. This deletion unmasked the heterozygous OPA1 variant, rendering it hemizygous in the patient.","FKM","OPA1","yes","Behr syndrome","210000","1239"," PMCID: PMC7469303  PMID: 32883255",,,,
660,"A male infant was born at 30 weeks and 3 days of gestation to a gravida 2, para 1, abortus 1 Lebanese mother and an Egyptian father. The pregnancy was complicated by gestational hypertension, and delivery was performed via urgent cesarean section due to preeclampsia. APGAR scores were 8 at one minute and 9 at five minutes. The neonate’s birth weight was 1,390 g. Following birth, the infant developed respiratory distress and was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), where he was diagnosed with hyaline membrane disease. He was treated with two doses of surfactant and required mechanical ventilation. On day 23 of life, the infant developed Enterococcus bacteremia and completed a 10-day course of vancomycin. On day 36, he presented with Enterobacter urinary tract infection (UTI) and direct hyperbilirubinemia, with total bilirubin at 6.5 mg/dL and direct bilirubin at 5.7 mg/dL. Liver function tests showed elevated SGPT (111 U/L), GGT (71 U/L), and alkaline phosphatase (738 U/L). Alpha-1 antitrypsin was within normal range. A 7-day course of cefotaxime was administered, but bilirubin levels remained elevated (6.5/5.7 mg/dL).

Persistent direct hyperbilirubinemia was noted, with bilirubin levels rising to 9.4/8.23 mg/dL, SGPT increased to 149 U/L, and borderline hypoglycemia developed while the infant was fed a preterm formula. A metabolic disorder or cystic fibrosis was suspected after extensive evaluation. DNA testing for cystic fibrosis was negative at 50 days of life. Plasma amino acid analysis revealed elevated tyrosine (263 μmol/L), and urine organic acids showed increased 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate acid, and 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acids. Alpha-fetoprotein exceeded 121,000 ng/dL. Genetic testing revealed the p.A33T (c.97G>A) variant in heterozygous form. Parental testing was not performed. The infant was transitioned to a tyrosine-free formula, leading to a reduction in plasma tyrosine (16 μmol/L) and bilirubin (5/2 mg/dL) after 30 days, with subsequent weight gain reaching 2.8 kg by 45 days post-intervention.","FKM","HPD","yes","Hawkinsinuria","140350","2118"," PMID: 30984715 PMCID: PMC6449416 DOI: 10.3389/fped.2019.00069",,,,

Her length measured 56 cm, which corresponds to the 50th percentile for a 2-month-old infant, while her weight was 4,200 g (50th percentile for 1.5 months), and her occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) was 38 cm (50th percentile for 2 months). She presented with hypotonia, sparse hair resembling baldness, mild pretibial edema, and persistent metabolic acidosis. Blood analysis revealed a pH of 7.29 and consistently low serum bicarbonate levels between 10-14 mEq/L. Typical serum electrolyte levels included sodium 138, potassium 4.6, bicarbonate 10, chloride 110 mEq/L, and on another occasion, sodium 135, potassium 4.3, bicarbonate 10, chloride 108 mEq/L. There was no indication of an unusual body odor. K.B. experienced normal intrauterine growth, with a birth weight of 3,580 g. Prior to evaluation, she was fed a standard formula, from which she received approximately 2.8 g/kg/day of protein and 112 kcal/kg/day of energy from dietary sources.

Following confirmation of the diagnosis at 8 months of age, K.B. was started on a protein-restricted diet of 1.5 g/kg/day, utilizing a formula restricted in phenylalanine and tyrosine (Mead Johnson 3200AB), alongside caloric supplementation with carbohydrates and fats (Mead Johnson 80056), aiming for 100 kcal/kg/day. Additionally, ascorbic acid (500 mg/day) was provided as a dietary supplement. These dietary changes led to a notable improvement in her clinical appearance and growth. She began to gain weight promptly, experienced an increase in stature, and demonstrated improved growth in OFC. By age 2, her height and weight were at the 10th percentile for age, and by age 3, her OFC had reached the 5th percentile.

She was alert and responsive during infancy. Laboratory tests revealed a compensated metabolic acidosis. Despite this, she continued to exhibit poor growth and persistent metabolic acidosis by 10 months of age. On at least one occasion, she became ill after consuming homogenized cow’s milk. Additionally, she was found to have a low level of thyroid hormone (T3). Treatment with thyroid hormone and sodium bicarbonate led to some improvement in her growth, and by 1 year of age, her T3 levels normalized, allowing discontinuation of thyroid supplementation.

Following diagnosis, she was treated with ascorbic acid. By 21 months of age, her intellectual development was assessed as normal, although her growth remained below the third centile. She generally refused to consume adequate calories, and episodes of reduced oral intake were associated with ketonuria.

663,"A 30-year-old male patient was evaluated for persistently elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol three years after being initially diagnosed with a lipid disorder. Routine blood examination confirmed high cholesterol levels. He was started on rosuvastatin 10 mg, which had no significant impact on cholesterol levels, leading to discontinuation of the medication after several months. The patient also has a history of chronic mild thrombocytopenia characterized by the presence of megakaryocytes and managed conservatively. There is a family history of lipid abnormalities in his father and paternal uncle. Additionally, the patient's parents are first cousins, indicating a consanguineous relationship. The patient has no other known medical conditions, maintains regular physical activity, and reports no history of chest pain or reduced exercise capacity. He has never undergone investigations for cardiovascular diseases. On clinical examination, a small xanthoma was observed at the elbow tendon, with no xanthelasma or organ enlargement noted. Repeated blood tests confirmed persistently elevated LDL cholesterol levels.

The patient was subsequently prescribed rosuvastatin 20 mg daily, based on an initial consideration of mixed hypercholesterolemia or a heterozygous inherited cholesterol disorder. However, after three months, there was minimal change in LDL levels. Genetic testing was then performed using a panel of 46 genes related to hereditary cholesterol disorders. The patient was found to have a homozygous missense mutation in the ABCG8 gene (c.1715T > C, p.(Leu572Pro)), which has previously been linked to a rare inherited sterol metabolism disorder. Following this genetic finding, rosuvastatin was discontinued, and the patient was started on ezetimibe 10 mg daily. After three months of treatment, there was a marked improvement in LDL cholesterol levels. Plant sterol measurement was not conducted due to unavailability.

664,"A 24-year-old Japanese woman was referred to a university hospital due to a markedly elevated serum LDL-C level of 332 mg/dL, identified during a routine medical checkup. Her vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 90/57 mmHg, pulse rate of 60 beats per minute, and temperature of 35.9 °C. She had a low body mass index (17.1 kg/m²), weighing 46 kg at a height of 164 cm. Laboratory tests revealed normal liver and kidney function, low triglycerides, high HDL-C, and elevated apolipoprotein B. Notably, she lacked cutaneous or tuberous xanthomas, but imaging studies showed thickened Achilles tendons (8.4/8.5 mm) and increased intima–media thickness (1.2 mm) at the carotid artery bifurcation.

Initial treatment included dietary modification (1700 kcal/day) and 5 mg/day rosuvastatin, later increased to 10 mg/day, but her LDL-C level remained high (220 mg/dL). Upon addition of 10 mg/day ezetimibe, her LDL-C dropped significantly to 46 mg/dL. Ezetimibe monotherapy at 10 mg/day effectively maintained her LDL-C around 70 mg/dL.

Due to the marked response to ezetimibe and poor response to rosuvastatin, serum plant sterol levels were assessed and found to be elevated: sitosterol at 10.5 μg/mL and campesterol at 21.7 μg/mL. These levels normalized with ezetimibe therapy. Genetic analysis identified a heterozygous Met429Val variant in the ABCG8 gene.

666,"A 9-year-old Chinese boy presented with cutaneous xanthomatosis persisting for six years. His developmental milestones were within normal limits. Yellow streaks were first noted on his fingers at approximately three years of age. Initial laboratory evaluations revealed elevated total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), leading to a misdiagnosis at a local hospital. There was no history of anemia, bleeding, joint pain, or joint inflammation. He was the second child (G2P2) of healthy, non-consanguineous parents and had a healthy older sister. The family history was unremarkable for hypercholesterolemia or premature coronary artery disease.

On physical examination, his height and weight were at the 50th percentile for his age, based on Chinese growth references. Multiple dermal plaques, measuring 0.3 to 0.5 cm in diameter, were observed on the fingers, elbows, and gluteal folds. Cardiovascular examination was unremarkable with no evidence of premature cardiovascular disease. Examination of the lungs, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes did not reveal any abnormalities.

Laboratory analysis demonstrated significantly elevated lipid levels: TC 557 mg/dL (normal <170 mg/dL), LDL-C 430 mg/dL (normal <110 mg/dL), and apolipoprotein B 229 g/dL (normal <90 g/dL). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), total triglycerides, and apolipoprotein A1 were within normal limits. Routine liver function tests, renal function tests, and urinalysis were normal. Abdominal ultrasound did not show hepatosplenomegaly or liver steatosis.

Molecular genetic testing identified a homozygous c.1166G>A mutation in exon 9 of the ABCG5 gene, resulting in an Arg389His missense substitution. Both parents were heterozygous carriers of this mutation. Additionally, the proband's father carried compound heterozygous mutations in the ABCA1 gene: c.3121C>G (Leu1041Val) and c.5002G>A (Val1668Ile). The proband's sister did not undergo genetic testing.

Initially, the patient was managed with a low-cholesterol diet, which led to a partial reduction in TC and LDL-C levels (262 mg/dL and 166 mg/dL, respectively). However, the xanthomas progressed, forming a tuberous mass approximately 5 cm in diameter on the left elbow after 18 months. Ultrasound imaging revealed a hypoechoic mass (53 × 36 × 12 mm) with minimal blood flow in the lesion. Subsequent treatment with a combined low-cholesterol and low-phytosterol diet over 30 months resulted in normalization of lipid levels and a reduction in xanthoma size.","FKM","ABCG8","yes","ABCG5-associated sitosterolemia","210250","2882"," PMID: 30985648 PMCID: PMC6485811 DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000015013",,,,
667,"a 7-year-old boy who presented to our department with multiple xanthomas. He was the only child of parents with no significant medical history. The initial appearance of xanthomas was noted by his parents on his elbows at around 6.5 years of age. There was no reported history of anemia, bleeding, joint pain, or arthritis. Additionally, there was no family history of lipid disorders or premature cardiovascular disease.

On physical examination, his height was 120.7 cm and weight was 20.8 kg, both falling between –1 standard deviation and the median for Chinese boys of the same age. Skin examination revealed small dermal xanthomas, approximately 0.5 cm in diameter, on the buttocks and elbows. Cardiovascular examination was normal, and no abnormalities were found in the lungs, liver, spleen, or lymph nodes.

Serum lipid analysis showed markedly elevated total cholesterol (478 mg/dL), LDL-C (359 mg/dL), and apolipoprotein B (184 mg/dL), with borderline low HDL-C (41 mg/dL). Total triglycerides were within normal limits (29 mg/dL), and apolipoprotein A1 was slightly reduced (103 mg/dL). Liver and kidney function tests, as well as blood and urine analyses, were within normal ranges.

Genetic testing revealed a homozygous c.751C>T mutation in exon 6 of the ABCG5 gene, resulting in a premature stop codon at position 251 (Gln251*), which leads to truncated protein production. Both parents were heterozygous carriers of the same mutation, while his younger sister showed no related genetic alteration.

No pharmacologic intervention was administered. After 12 months on a low-cholesterol diet, his total cholesterol and LDL-C levels decreased significantly to 258 mg/dL and 159 mg/dL, respectively.

668,"A healthy 17-year-old high school student presented with acute-onset chest pain and was referred for evaluation. He had no significant personal or family medical history, and there was no evidence of consanguinity in his parents. Electrocardiography showed a negative T wave in leads II, III, and aVF, along with ST elevation in lead aVL. Biochemical analysis revealed elevated cardiac troponin T (0.235 ng/mL), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (3.493 mg/dL), and markedly elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (414 mg/dL). Physical examination identified xanthomas over the elbows and Achilles tendons, a systolic murmur of Levine IV at the apex, and audible bruits over the carotid and subclavian arteries. Imaging confirmed thickened Achilles tendons, and echocardiography demonstrated moderate mitral valve regurgitation with no left ventricular asynergy. Coronary angiography revealed severe stenosis in the right coronary artery (99%) and significant stenosis in the left anterior descending and left circumflex arteries (75%). These findings led to a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome associated with a lipid metabolism disorder.

Given his age and elevated LDL-C levels, the patient was started on intensive lipid-lowering therapy, including rosuvastatin, ezetimibe, probucol, and evolocumab, achieving an LDL-C level below 180 mg/dL within 31 days. Percutaneous coronary intervention was then performed for the right coronary artery. Optical coherence tomography during the procedure revealed signs of vulnerable plaque, including macrophage accumulation, healed and ruptured plaques, and large lipid deposits. Post-intervention, chest pain resolved, but persistent high CRP levels and recurrent fever prompted further investigation. Imaging studies demonstrated vascular wall thickening in the aortic arch and carotid arteries, leading to the diagnosis of a systemic vasculitis. The patient was treated with prednisolone and tocilizumab, which normalized CRP levels. At 18 months, follow-up coronary angiography showed slight regression of coronary artery stenosis, and LDL-C and CRP levels remained low for over three years without recurrence of symptoms.

During his second hospitalization, the patient developed thrombocytopenia (70,000-100,000 /μL) and macrothrombocytes, with associated intestinal bleeding of unknown origin, leading to the discontinuation of clopidogrel. Due to extremely elevated LDL-C levels and absence of dyslipidemia in his parents, genetic testing was conducted.

669,"A 15-month-old Korean girl presented with multiple yellow dermal plaques located in the flexural areas. Her parents first noticed these lesions at 3 months of age while she was being exclusively breastfed. At the time of her initial visit, breast milk accounted for one-third of her daily energy intake, with the remaining two-thirds derived from solid foods such as rice, meats, and vegetables, which had been introduced at 6 months of age. She was born to healthy, non-consanguineous parents, with no family history of dyslipidemia or premature cardiovascular disease.

Her height and weight were within the 25th–50th percentiles. Physical examination revealed multiple yellowish plaques on her wrist, neck, and gluteal folds, consistent with intertriginous xanthomas. There were no signs of goiter or hepatomegaly. Laboratory evaluation showed markedly elevated total cholesterol and LDL-C levels at 675 and 540 mg/dL, respectively. Her HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides were 46 and 51 mg/dL, respectively. Both parents had normal lipid profiles. A biopsy of the dermal plaques confirmed xanthoma with diffuse dermal foam cell proliferation.

A low-saturated-fat, low-cholesterol diet was initiated, and cholestyramine (0.24 g/kg/day) was prescribed at 16 months of age. Her cholesterol levels unexpectedly normalized within 2 months. As her lipid profile remained in the low-normal range, cholestyramine was gradually tapered and discontinued at 25 months. The xanthomas regressed and completely disappeared by the age of 3 years. Despite normal development, her growth decelerated, with height between the 10th–25th percentile and weight between the 5th–10th percentile at 54 months.

At 3 years of age, when her total cholesterol and LDL-C were 184 and 118 mg/dL, respectively, a plasma sample was stored at −80°C for future analysis. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) performed at 56 months revealed an extremely elevated plasma sitosterol level of 19.36 mg/dL (normal range, 0.3–1.7 mg/dL).

The parents are asymptomatic carriers of a gene mutation but do not exhibit symptoms of the disease described below. The first case, a 9-year-old male, presented at Dalang Hospital of Dongguan with masses in the buttocks and extremities, which had developed progressively over four years.

In July 2017, the child was evaluated at Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center for “masses in the limbs and buttocks.” Multiple xanthomas were identified in the buttocks and joints. Laboratory tests revealed elevated blood lipid levels: serum total cholesterol (15.13 mmol/L), triglycerides (1.95 mmol/L), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.99 mmol/L), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (14.04 mmol/L), apolipoprotein B (3.08 g/L), apolipoprotein E (95.4 mg/L), and free fatty acids (1.4 mmol/L). Despite lipid-lowering therapy, the masses enlarged over time.

In April 2020, he was admitted to the Department of Pediatrics at the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University due to persistent xanthomas and arrhythmia. Physical examination showed growth retardation, multiple soft yellowish-brown nodules primarily at large joints, and xanthelasmas on the eyelids. His heart rate was irregular with premature beats. Laboratory data showed slightly improved lipid profiles but elevated inflammatory markers and signs of arterial inflammation and stenosis on Doppler ultrasound. An ECG confirmed frequent premature beats and arrhythmia. Genetic testing detected two pathogenic heterozygous mutations in the ABCG5 gene, inherited separately from each parent.

The diagnoses included a hereditary lipid metabolism disorder, multiple arterial stenoses, arrhythmia, and moderate growth retardation. Treatment included ezetimibe for lipid control and clopidogrel for anticoagulation. The buttock masses softened but showed limited reduction in size.

In July 2021, the patient revisited Dalang Hospital with xanthomas at the bilateral buttocks. Examination revealed large round masses without ulceration, partial shrinkage of masses at the knees, and postoperative scars from prior elbow surgeries. ECG showed sinus arrhythmia with frequent premature atrial contractions. Laboratory values indicated moderately elevated cholesterol levels.

Surgical removal of the masses under general anesthesia was performed. The excised tissue, located at the superficial fascia, was pale yellow, tough, and comprised foam-like histiocytes, multinucleated macrophages, and fibrous tissue. Pathology confirmed tuberous xanthoma. Postoperative recovery was successful, with continued lipid-lowering and anticoagulation therapy.

671,"A female patient, aged 7 years, was admitted in January 2022 with a chief complaint of ""bumps in both elbows for more than 2 years."" The family reported noticing masses in both elbow joints over two years prior, which had gradually increased in size. These masses were painless, non-ulcerative, and did not restrict elbow movement. The patient was admitted for surgical management following outpatient evaluation.

In March 2020, molecular hereditary testing was performed at Guangzhou KingMed Diagnostics Center. The patient was found to have a splice mutation at intron 7 and intron 9 on chromosome 2p21 of the ABCG5 gene. This result was consistent with findings in a previously documented case.

Upon physical examination, the patient had normal vital signs (T = 36.3°C, P = 87 bpm, R = 20 breaths/min, BP = 105/58 mmHg). She was alert, well-developed, and moderately nourished. Lung sounds were clear, and there were no cardiac murmurs, although the heart rhythm was irregular at 87 bpm. On the extensor surfaces of both elbow joints, non-tender bulges measuring approximately 7.5 × 7.5 cm on the right and 3.7 × 2.2 cm on the left were observed. The skin was intact over the masses, which had a tough texture and well-defined boundaries. There was no joint swelling, pain, or restricted motion. No xanthelasma was noted on the eyelids.

Laboratory tests revealed TG = 0.72 mmol/L, TC = 7.01 mmol/L, HDL-C = 1.65 mmol/L, LDL-C = 3.94 mmol/L, HDL-C/LDL-C ratio = 0.42, Apo A1 = 1.42 g/L, and Apo B = 1.57 g/L. ECG findings indicated sinus arrhythmia. Color Doppler ultrasonography showed normal inner diameters of bilateral carotid arteries, with irregular thickening of the carotid walls—1.5 mm on the left and 1.2 mm on the right at their thickest points.

The patient was treated with Ezetimibe for long-term lipid-lowering therapy. Surgical resection of the bilateral elbow masses was performed, and postoperative pathology confirmed the presence of xanthoma. At a 3-month follow-up, the surgical site had healed well.

674,"A 44-year-old woman with a complex medical history was referred for evaluation of scarring alopecia and generalized keratosis pilaris. She reported developing a rash and progressive hair loss starting at 9 years of age, which had worsened over time despite the use of topical corticosteroids, emollients, and moisturizers. Examination showed scarring alopecia of the vertex and frontal scalp, along with generalized erythematous, keratotic, folliculocentric papules on the malar area, trunk, and extremities. Thinning of the eyebrows was also present. A scalp biopsy indicated mild alopecia with perifollicular fibrosis but no inflammation. Direct immunofluorescence testing was negative.

675,"A 28-year-old woman was referred to the dermatology department in Oxford due to progressive scarring alopecia. She reported that her mother had experienced similar symptoms and was concerned about the likelihood of her asymptomatic 7-year-old daughter developing the same condition. Her symptoms began five years earlier with a small patch of hair loss at the vertex, which progressively enlarged and was occasionally accompanied by scalp irritation. Additional symptoms included persistently red cheeks, red rough patches over the supraorbital area leading to loss of eyebrows, sparse eyelashes, and rough skin on the arms and thighs. A scalp biopsy performed in 1995 at another facility indicated scarring alopecia, and immunofluorescence testing showed granular IgM along the basement membrane. Based on these findings, a diagnosis was initially made and treated with antimalarials and topical steroids, though hair loss continued to progress.

On clinical examination, there was follicular erythema and significant scarring at the vertex of the scalp, along with multiple erythematous papules on the eyelashes and nearly absent eyebrows showing follicular plugging. Spinulous follicular hyperkeratosis was evident on the extensor surfaces of the arms, thighs, and legs. The patient did not present with palmoplantar hyperkeratosis. She wore spectacles for myopia and astigmatism but did not experience photophobia.

Two skin punch biopsies from her arm were analyzed using horizontal and vertical sectioning. Histopathology revealed marked peri-infundibular fibrosis, thinning of the infundibular epithelium, sebaceous gland atrophy, and a peripheral rim of small lymphocytes. A moderate superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate was also present. No basal vacuolar changes or apoptotic bodies were found in the infundibular epithelium or epidermis. A review of the previous 1995 biopsy displayed similar findings, with no interface changes suggestive of the initially proposed diagnosis.

The alopecia was accompanied by scalp irritation and gradually progressed over several years to include the loss of her eyebrows and eyelashes. Prior to the onset of hair loss, she experienced roughness of the skin over her eyebrows, arms, thighs, and legs. She did not report any symptoms indicating involvement of the eyes.

Clinical examination revealed advanced scarring alopecia across nearly the entire scalp, described as ""burnt-out,"" with no signs of active inflammation or ongoing disease.

677,"A 75-year-old Japanese woman (II-6) first visited the hospital at age 73 years due to involuntary movements in her neck and upper limbs. She also had a family history suggestive of a neurodegenerative disorder. Genetic testing confirmed the presence of a 42-repeat abnormality in the HTT gene. Cognitive assessments revealed scores of 25 on the Mini-Mental State Examination and 10 on the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale—Cognitive Subscale. Tetrabenazine was initiated but discontinued due to adverse effects such as nausea and fatigue. The patient’s older brother (II-5) experienced rapid progression of similar symptoms, becoming bedridden within 5 years. She took memantine for 5 years without notable side effects.

Magnetic resonance imaging showed changes in the striatum, and IMP-SPECT indicated decreased blood flow in the precuneus and posterior cingulate gyrus—patterns typically associated with Alzheimer’s-type dementia. Based on these findings, treatment followed a strategy for a case involving both neurodegenerative movement disorder and Alzheimer’s-type dementia.

Initially, donepezil was considered, but due to irritability, low-dose memantine (5 mg/day) was started, resulting in improvements in chorea, swallowing, and oral symptoms. When the dose was increased to 10 mg/day, the chorea worsened, leading to a return to the 5 mg/day dosage. Over the subsequent 5 years, there was no substantial worsening of clinical symptoms, gait, or balance. Follow-up IMP-SPECT revealed improved cerebral blood flow in the frontotemporal region.

678,"A male patient first presented at 2 years and 9 months of age with unsteady gait. He was born full term without complications, and a developmental assessment at 17 months was normal. However, his mother reported a steady decline in function over the following year. On initial neurological examination, he could follow simple commands and had a limited vocabulary of approximately 25 words. He exhibited full extraocular movements without nystagmus but showed truncal titubation and an ataxic, broad-based gait. Tone, strength, and reflexes were normal at that time. Despite participation in physical, occupational, and speech therapy over the next year, he continued to regress. By age 4, he was nonverbal, had poor head control, and had lost the ability to walk. Examination at this point revealed mild hypotonia and hyperreflexia. By age 5, he had developed severe oropharyngeal dysfunction requiring gastrostomy tube placement, and his tone had progressed to severe rigidity.

The patient’s maternal report included a family history of neurodegenerative disease in the paternal grandmother. Specifics of this diagnosis were unclear due to lack of access to the father, who was incarcerated and unavailable. Reportedly, the father had no symptoms and had never been tested. A genetic counselor was consulted early in the diagnostic process and advised against genetic testing for ethical reasons, especially given the atypically early symptom onset. Testing was deferred due to concerns about revealing an unrelated adult-onset condition.

Neuroimaging at 3 years old revealed moderate cerebellar atrophy. By age 5, follow-up MRI demonstrated progression to severe cerebellar atrophy with mild diffuse cerebral white matter volume loss, but no caudate atrophy was evident. Laboratory evaluation for metabolic disorders, chromosomal microarray, and multiple genetic and metabolic investigations including whole-exome and mitochondrial DNA sequencing were unremarkable.

At 7 years old, the patient was referred to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network. Given the family history and disease progression, testing was reconsidered. Genetic analysis revealed an expansion of 250 to 350 CAG repeats. This result was verified and confirmed. The family was counseled regarding the diagnosis and familial risk. The patient’s 9-year-old brother, who had a history of seizures, behavioral concerns, and recent neurologic decline, was found to have 98 CAG repeats upon testing, confirming the diagnosis in a second sibling.","FKM","HTT","yes","Huntington disease (HTT)","143100","399"," PMID: 37840138 PMCID: PMC10578007 DOI: 10.1186/s13256-023-04161-z",,,,

Her clinical course was marked by persistent feeding difficulties requiring gastric tube and parenteral nutrition, recurrent infections, and pulmonary complications necessitating prolonged glucocorticoid therapy. From infancy, she exhibited spontaneous episodes of hypoglycemia without clinical symptoms, progressing to dysglycemia and manifest diabetes mellitus by 1.8 years of age, characterized by both hyper- and hypoglycemia, impaired beta-cell responsiveness, and slowly rising GAD-autoantibodies. Despite persistent glycemic instability, sulfonylurea therapy failed to improve control. A switch to a high-fiber, low-glycemic index tube feeding formula significantly stabilized glucose levels and reduced variability, allowing maintenance of glycemic control without insulin therapy over a 12-month period.

680,"A 13-year-old female patient presented to our hospital accompanied by her parents, with complaints of severe cutaneous ulceration and scarring on the face and hands, along with areas of dyspigmentation. Her appearance seemed much older than her actual age. According to her parents, symptoms began during infancy, with severe skin redness and blistering in sun-exposed areas following outdoor activities. These initial lesions progressed into ulcerations, resulting in scarring and deformity, particularly affecting the nose, hands, and fingers. Additionally, they reported a history of urine discoloration during her early childhood. The family had lived under prolonged conflict in northern Syria, where inadequate security and healthcare infrastructure prevented timely and accurate diagnosis and treatment. There was no known consanguinity between the parents or similar symptoms reported in close relatives. Prior to her arrival, the patient had only received local antibiotics with no specific diagnosis due to limited medical resources.

Physical examination revealed extensive dyspigmentation and hypertrichosis, predominantly on the cheeks and forehead, along with crust formation over previous ulcers. The central facial region showed a sclerodermatous texture, with atrophic lesions in linear and spotted patterns. The nose was markedly scarred and deformed, and the teeth showed reddish-brown discoloration under visible light. Eye examination indicated conjunctivitis, scleromalacia, and mild blepharitis without corneal involvement. The dorsum of the hands displayed extensive ulcerations and sclerodermatous changes, along with acrolysis at the fingertips, causing noticeable shortening and deformity of the digits. A palpable liver edge was noted 2 cm below the costal margin, while the spleen was not palpable. Fluorescence spectroscopy using a Wood’s lamp demonstrated bright red fluorescence of the teeth and bright green fluorescence in the interdigital spaces of the hands.

Laboratory evaluation revealed elevated levels of porphyrins, notably uroporphyrins and coproporphyrin-I, in the 24-hour urine sample. Based on the clinical history, physical findings, and laboratory results, a diagnosis was established. The patient was educated about the condition and advised on rigorous photoprotection, including the use of high-SPF sunscreens. Treatment involved vitamin D supplementation, regular blood transfusions, and iron chelation therapy with deferasirox. After one month, the patient exhibited significant clinical improvement with resolution of active ulcers and enhanced skin pigmentation and elasticity. She expressed satisfaction with the treatment outcome and demonstrated increased adherence to follow-up visits. Over a seven-month period, her condition remained stable without new complications, although psychological support was recommended to address the psychosocial impact. Additionally, the patient was informed about the potential benefits of skin resurfacing procedures to improve residual scarring and dyspigmentation.","FKM","UROS","yes","Congenital erythropoietic porphyria","263700","79277"," PMID: 32728454 PMCID: PMC7376977 DOI: 10.1093/omcr/omaa051",,,,
681,"A 10-year-old male of Asian descent presented to the outpatient department with a history of an episode of epistaxis approximately 1.5 months prior. He had experienced recurrent episodes of epistaxis over the past six months and had a history of skin blister formation, particularly exacerbated by exposure to sunlight.

The patient was born from a nonconsanguineous marriage, with no family history of similar symptoms. His gestational and birth history was uneventful, with a birth weight of 2.5 kg, a head circumference of 38 cm, and an APGAR score of 7. He met age-appropriate developmental milestones but did not receive vaccinations beyond BCG. His medical history included multiple visits for skin blistering affecting the hands, feet, face, and neck, as well as reports of darkened urine. He had not undergone thorough medical evaluation nor received treatment aside from sun avoidance advice and topical moisturizers. The patient had no other chronic conditions or surgical history.

He was raised in Gilgit Baltistan, a region in northern Pakistan, and belonged to a low socio-economic background. He followed a traditional diet rich in fruits and nuts and had a healthy sleep routine. He was not sexually active and had no history of substance use. The child enjoyed outdoor activities but had to limit them due to sensitivity to sunlight.

On physical examination, the patient was alert and oriented with stable vital signs. He exhibited pallor, facial scarring, thin sparse hair, brown teeth, and a distorted facial structure. His skin showed thickening, hypopigmentation, hyperpigmentation, and scarring, especially in sun-exposed areas, along with facial hypertrichosis. His right index finger displayed nail deformities, including anonychia and onycholysis, as well as brachydactyly. Anthropometric measurements showed a weight of 20 kg (5th percentile), height of 120 cm (10th percentile), and a head circumference of 115 cm.

Abdominal examination revealed hepatosplenomegaly, while neurological examination and other systemic reviews were unremarkable. Initial investigations showed markedly elevated levels of urinary and blood porphyrins, including uroporphyrins, coproporphyrin I and III, and erythrocyte porphyrins. Uroporphyrinogen III synthase activity was undetectable. Additional laboratory findings included microcytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated reticulocyte count, and increased markers of hemolysis and inflammation. Peripheral blood smear supported hemolytic anemia, revealing poikilocytosis, anisocytosis, polychromasia, and basophilic stippling.

Given the clinical presentation and biochemical findings, a diagnosis was confirmed. Due to persistent thrombocytopenia and recurrent epistaxis, the patient underwent a successful splenectomy after appropriate preoperative optimization. Postoperatively, he received supportive medications and blood transfusions, with no complications. He was discharged on the fifth postoperative day and continued regular follow-up. At subsequent visits, his platelet count normalized, and no further episodes of epistaxis occurred.

Sun exposure from age two triggered vesiculobullous skin lesions on exposed areas, often complicated by secondary infections and leading to significant scarring, limited mouth opening, joint contractures, and nail loss. Despite normal growth trends below the 10th percentile and generally stable systemic health, she experienced episodes of glomerulonephritis, cellulitis, and trauma-related injuries. Hematologic findings included fluctuating hematocrit levels, occasional nucleated red blood cells, and normal biochemical profiles.

686,"A male neonate was born at term as the first child to nonconsanguineous parents following a normal pregnancy and uneventful delivery, with a birth weight of 3300 g (50th–90th percentile). His Apgar score was 8. During the first 24 hours of life, blood glucose levels ranged from 0.7 to 2.8 mmol/L (reference interval: 4.2–6.3 mmol/L) and have remained abnormal. On the second day of life, he was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit due to hypotonia, feeding difficulties, recurrent vomiting, hyperammonemia, and hypoglycemia. Blood acylcarnitine analysis revealed elevated levels of long and medium chain acylcarnitines, including butyryl carnitine (C4), octanoylcarnitine (C8), decanoylcarnitine (C10), dodecanoylcarnitine (C12), and myristoylcarnitine (C14). Additional laboratory findings included elevated ALT (78.2 U/L; normal < 50 U/L), AST (292 U/L; normal < 40 U/L), lactate (6.5 mmol/L; normal < 2.1 mmol/L), plasma ammonia (59.6 µmol/L; normal < 33 µmol/L), and creatine kinase isoenzymes (13.94 ng/mL; normal < 6.3 ng/mL).

Exome sequencing of the patient and his parents revealed compound heterozygous mutations in the ETFDH gene. The patient carried c.413T>G (p.Leu138Arg) in exon 4 and c.1667C>G (p.Pro556Arg) in exon 12, both missense mutations. The c.413T>G variant was inherited from the mother, while the c.1667C>G variant was inherited from the father. Structural modeling of the ETFDH protein using CLC Genomics Workbench, PSIPRED, RaptorX, and Chimera indicated that these mutations altered the spatial configuration of the protein, likely affecting its translation and function.

Based on the clinical presentation, biochemical findings, and genetic analysis, a diagnosis was confirmed. The patient was managed with a high-calorie, reduced-fat diet and oral L-carnitine supplementation (150 mg/day), which led to marked clinical improvement within one week. Despite initial recovery, he experienced recurrent episodes of vomiting and hypoglycemia after discharge. At two months of age, hypotonia and delayed motor development were noted, prompting rehabilitation therapy, which provided some symptom relief.

687,"A male preterm infant was delivered at 32 + 6 weeks of gestation via caesarean section due to foetal bradycardia and podalic presentation. The pregnancy was complicated by oligohydramnios and a large cerebral cyst, both detected at 28 + 2 weeks of gestation. The infant was born to healthy, non-consanguineous parents. Birth measurements included a weight of 1230 g (<10th centile), length of 40.0 cm (10th centile), and occipital-frontal circumference of 27.5 cm (<3rd centile). Apgar scores were 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The newborn was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit with moderate respiratory distress requiring CPAP ventilation. Initial blood gas analysis indicated metabolic acidosis (pH 7.11, lactate 6.2 mmol/L), along with hyperchloremia and normal glycemia and ammoniemia. Clinical examination showed facial dysmorphisms, bilateral syndactyly of the 2nd and 4th toes, and an empty scrotum. Minimal enteral feeding and total parenteral nutrition were initiated.

On day 2 of life, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis persisted despite bicarbonate therapy, and was associated with elevated liver transaminases, hyperglycemia (250 mg/dl) with glycosuria, and no ketonuria. The infant received a red blood cell transfusion due to anemia (hemoglobin 8.6 g/dl). Abdominal ultrasound revealed echogenic kidneys with poor cortico-medullary differentiation. On day 3, leukopenia and neutropenia developed, prompting administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Metabolic acidosis remained refractory to bicarbonate treatment. A distinct ""sweaty feet"" odor was noted in the urine, prompting metabolic investigations including urine organic acids, bloodspot screening, and plasma acylcarnitine profiling. Genetic samples were also collected from the infant and parents.

By day 4, the infant's condition deteriorated rapidly, with severe respiratory failure, declining renal function (diuresis reduction, blood urea 171 mg/dl, creatinine 1.8 mg/dl), and elevated ammonemia (225 mmol/L). Despite intensive care, including mechanical ventilation, the newborn passed away on day 5. An autopsy was not performed. On the same day, results from metabolic tests showed abnormal acylcarnitine profiles with elevated medium- and long-chain species (e.g., C4, C5, C14, C16, C18) and increased amino acids (arginine, citrulline, glycine, methionine, proline, tyrosine). Urine analysis revealed elevated lactic, glutaric, adipic, isovaleric, and parahydroxyphenyllactic acids, along with isovalerylglycine. Genetic testing identified a homozygous mutation in the ETFDH gene (c606 + 1_606 + 2insT), inherited from heterozygous carrier parents, and the same mutation was detected in the mother's sister.

688,"A nine-month-old boy presented with chief complaints of vomiting and mental fatigue, which had persisted for half a day according to his parents. The previous day, the child had vomited stomach contents twice without any apparent trigger and subsequently showed signs of mental fatigue and hypoglycemia. Despite outpatient treatment, his symptoms of fatigue, poor responsiveness, and reduced appetite persisted. His parents denied any issues with diet. He was transferred to our hospital for further evaluation. Since the onset of symptoms, he exhibited mental fatigue, decreased appetite, and poor sleep, though his body weight remained stable.

The patient's health and personal history included the following: (1) Birth history: Second child, full-term vaginal delivery with a birth weight of 3.85 kg. (2) Newborn screening: On the third day after birth, elevated levels of C0, C6, C8, C10, C12, C14:1, and C14:2 were detected. (3) Feeding history: Breastfed for four months, then transitioned to formula feeding with the gradual introduction of complementary food at six months without adverse reactions. (4) Growth and developmental milestones: Normal early development with laughing at two months, stable neck control at three months, and the ability to turn over at five months. Upon admission at nine months, neck control was unstable. (5) Family history: Healthy parents in a non-consanguineous marriage. However, the patient’s sibling had abnormal screening results, poor health, low weight and height, and was susceptible to frequent colds.

Physical examination revealed a body weight of 9.0 kg and a height of 72 cm. The child displayed hypotonia in the limbs and unstable neck control. He was unable to sit unsupported due to weak lower limb strength, but bilateral knee and Achilles tendon reflexes were present and symmetrical. No sensory abnormalities were noted; physiological reflexes were intact, and Bruchner’s, Klinefelter’s, and double Barthel’s signs were negative. A preliminary diagnosis of a suspected genetic metabolic disorder was made.

Auxiliary examinations provided further insight: (1) Color Doppler ultrasound revealed hepatomegaly (liver extending 5.0 cm below the right rib) and enhanced liver parenchymal echo.

Treatment included ceftazidime for infection control, glutathione for liver protection, and metabolic support therapy with high-dose vitamin B2 (50 mg, tid), levocarnitine (10 ml, oral tid), and coenzyme Q10 (50 mg, tid). One week later, WES confirmed the diagnosis. At discharge, the child was more responsive but still showed hypotonia, unstable neck control, and poor postural support. Discharge treatment included levocarnitine (3.33 ml, oral tid), vitamin B2 (50 mg, tid), coenzyme Q10 (50 mg, tid), compound glycyrrhizin (half tablet tid), and a low-fat, low-protein, high-carbohydrate diet. Follow-up testing showed continued elevation of blood acylcarnitines, although urinary organic acids had normalized.

At the six-month follow-up, the child weighed 10.4 kg and measured 79 cm in height. He was able to sit unaided, crawl, turn over, stand briefly, speak simple words, and walk a few steps alone. Muscle tone and strength were normal, with no pathological signs. Blood mass spectrometry still indicated elevated C6, C8, C10, C10:1, C12, C14:1, and C14:2, but urinary organic acids remained within normal limits.

689,"A 4-year and 1-month-old girl, the sister of Proband 1, was brought to medical attention due to her brother's recent diagnosis and her own history of frequent illness, including susceptibility to colds and consistently low height and weight. Her newborn screening had previously revealed elevated levels of C6, C8, C10, C10:1, C12, C14, C14:1, and C14:2. Upon physical examination, her weight was 13 kg and height was 97.8 cm, both below the average for her age (-1 SD). Neurological examination was normal with symmetric bilateral knee and Achilles tendon reflexes, intact touch sensation, and the absence of pathological reflexes. Further laboratory analysis confirmed increased levels of the same acylcarnitines as in the newborn screening and elevated urinary 3–3-hydroxyphenyl-3-hydroxypropionic acid. Genetic testing through whole exome sequencing (WES), along with the clinical and biochemical findings, led to a diagnosis. The treatment regimen included oral vitamin B2 (50 mg twice daily) and coenzyme Q10 (50 mg twice daily).

At the six-month follow-up, her weight had increased to 14 kg and height to 100.2 cm, though both remained below average (-1 SD).

At the one-year follow-up, her weight reached 14.8 kg and height was 105.1 cm, still below the age norm (-1 SD). Blood tandem mass spectrometry continued to show elevated C6, C8, C10, C10:1, C12, C14:1, and C14:2 levels, but urinary organic acid analysis revealed normalization of 3–3-hydroxyphenyl-3-hydroxypropionic acid levels.","FKM","ETFDH","yes","ETFDH-associated MAD deficiency","231680","394532, 394529"," PMID: 36683804 PMCID: PMC9845722 DOI: 10.3389/fped.2022.1038440",,,,
690,"A 29-year-old single male, employed as a disabled civil servant, presented to the outpatient clinic accompanied by his family. Although he did not report any complaints, his family described a long-standing history of repetitive behaviors, irritability, limited communication, persecutory delusions, and socially impairing anxiety. Over the past month, they noted an increase in impulsive behaviors with sexual overtones, including inappropriate physical contact and viewing of explicit materials. Since childhood, he had displayed communication difficulties, maladaptive behaviors such as inappropriate yelling, aggression, and poor compliance with social norms. His persecutory ideations, first noted during his lycée years, had escalated to delusions in recent years. During evaluation, he used pronominal reversal when referring to himself and exhibited reduced eye contact and self-care, poor short-term memory, tangential speech, and impaired impulse control. Although previously diagnosed with moderate-to-severe cognitive delay (IQ = 45), he was re-evaluated and found to have mild intellectual impairment.

His medical history included childhood-onset simple partial epilepsy treated with sodium valproate for six years, with no seizures for the past 11 years. He had been prescribed risperidone since the age of 10. There was no history of substance use, head injury, or central nervous system infection. His mother, who was diagnosed with hypothyroidism during pregnancy and chronic depression later in life, had occupational exposure to radiation. His father had no known health conditions. His younger sibling was diagnosed with fragile X syndrome and epilepsy. The patient had delayed developmental milestones, poor suckling necessitating bottle feeding from infancy, and limited early social and motor development. He also displayed hyperactivity and violent tendencies during childhood and adolescence, including aggression involving sharp objects.

At work, he was employed in a supportive environment that accommodated his limitations, including difficulty waking and low motivation. His psychiatric examination revealed persecutory delusions, irritability, labile affect, and reduced social interaction. A prior diagnosis of moderate-to-severe intellectual disability was reconsidered in light of better test performance without seizure interference. Elevated prolactin was observed, attributed to antipsychotic use. EEG showed partial-onset epilepsy on a background of mild cerebral dysfunction, while MRI results were within normal limits despite motion artifacts.

Given his marfanoid habitus, syndromic features, and family history, differential diagnoses including several genetic syndromes were explored. Normal homocysteine levels excluded homocystinuria, and negative ophthalmologic findings ruled out Marfan syndrome. Although features aligned with a specific genetic syndrome, no pathogenic mutation was found in the MED12 gene (exon 22). Whole Exome Sequencing was initiated but pending.

His treatment plan included tapering off amisulpride, increasing risperidone to 4 mg/day, and adding carbamazepine for improved impulse control. Over eight months, partial improvements were observed in sexual behaviors and delusional content, with marked reduction in aggression and slightly improved social interaction, although eye contact remained limited. His work performance remained at a moderate level without notable change.

691,"The patient is a 23-year-old male admitted to a psychiatric hospital by judicial order due to ongoing criminal behavior. He is the eldest of three siblings, with a sister diagnosed with anorexia nervosa. His parents, non-consanguineous and reportedly healthy (aside from his mother’s malar hypoplasia), were 28 (father) and 25 (mother) years old at the time of his birth. The pregnancy and delivery were uneventful, with no reported alcohol exposure. He was born at term with a weight of 3,200 g and demonstrated mild weight loss in the first days of life. Early psychomotor development was globally delayed—he held his head unsupported at 6 months, walked at age 2 without prior crawling, and spoke his first words at 18 months. He had enuresis until ages 5–6 and encopresis until 10. Various medical issues occurred throughout childhood, including a misdiagnosed hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy at age 2, orchiopexy at age 4, and hypernasal speech requiring therapy by age 5. At age 11, imaging studies revealed partial absence of the corpus callosum and centroencephalic dysfunction, and he was subsequently diagnosed with a genetic syndrome. His karyotype was normal and fragile X testing was negative. Additional diagnoses included scoliosis and ankle valgus, which were surgically corrected. At age 23, a brain MRI revealed complete agenesis of the corpus callosum, lateral ventricle dilation, and cerebellar changes.

On physical examination at admission, he exhibited a tall, slender build with Marfanoid features including a long narrow face, high nasal bridge, micrognathia, malar hypoplasia, and high-arched palate. Other notable features included low-set ears, a short and deep philtrum, long thin fingers and toes, joint hyperextensibility, generalized hypotonia, and hypernasal voice. Secondary sexual characteristics and testicular size were normal. Behaviorally, he had been diagnosed with ADHD in early childhood and scored 89 on the WISC at age 9. By adolescence, he displayed behavioral issues such as impulsive spending and suicide attempts. Notably, he engaged in pyromania, including setting fire to the family business, driven by revenge and fascination with emergency responders. At admission, he was oriented and articulate but displayed fantasy-prone thinking, dramatization, low insight, poor self-criticism, and concrete thought patterns. He denied suicidal ideation, but exhibited low responsibility and poor emotional regulation.

His pharmacological treatment included oxcarbazepine (1,200 mg/day), quetiapine (500 mg/day), and clorazepate dipotassium (15 mg/day). Diagnoses included pyromania, unspecified personality disorder, and a genetic syndrome. His Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) score was 51. Neuropsychological assessment indicated borderline intellectual functioning with an overall IQ of 79, and further evaluation identified speech and writing impairments, psychomotor apraxia, tactile agnosia, visual memory deficits, and calculation difficulties. No lateralized deficits were found from the agenesis of the corpus callosum. The personality inventory results were inconclusive.","FKM","MED12","yes","Lujan-Fryns syndrome","309520","776"," PMID: 17036352 DOI: 10.1002/ajmg.a.31503",,,,

Additional features include captodactyly of the fifth finger on the left hand and an abnormal number of teeth. He underwent surgical correction for an ascending aortic aneurysm. Although formal psychometric testing was not conducted, he demonstrated more pronounced intellectual impairment compared to Patient 1. He reported a similar intense interest in law enforcement, military, and related professions, mirroring his nephew’s fascinations. The patient recounted experiencing behavioral disturbances during adolescence, including aggression and pyromania, which significantly diminished after the age of 25.

693,"A 20-year-old male from Norway presented with a longstanding history of ataxia, sensorineural hearing loss, and visual impairment. His early developmental milestones were normal until eight months of age, after which he experienced the first of three episodes of acute neurological deterioration, each associated with febrile illness. These episodes, occurring at 8 months, 18 months, and 4 years of age, resulted in transient loss of motor skills, with persistent gait and limb ataxia following the latter two episodes. Diagnostic evaluations during these acute episodes, including MRI and metabolic screening, were unremarkable.

During early childhood, he was diagnosed with bilateral optic atrophy and sensorineural hearing loss. Motor function gradually improved, and by adolescence, he showed notable recovery, though mild ataxia persisted. Hearing difficulties were addressed with bilateral cochlear implants, leading to improvements in communication and academic performance. Visual impairment remained significant, with further reductions in contrast sensitivity and visual acuity noted in late adolescence.

At 20 years of age, neurological evaluation revealed mild gait and limb ataxia, general areflexia, intention tremor, dysmetria, and bilateral optic atrophy. He had high-arched feet and reduced distal pain sensation, but normal muscle tone. Genetic testing identified a de novo c.2452G > A (p.Glu818Lys) mutation in the ATP1A3 gene. This mutation confirmed the diagnosis, which is typically characterized by recurrent fever-related neurological deterioration in early childhood, followed by residual ataxia, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss.

Early history and development including speech was normal with walking achieved at 14 months. At the age of two years and five months she became quiet and lethargic. She was diagnosed with otitis media and subsequently admitted to hospital for five weeks with presumed encephalitis. She had regressed losing the ability to sit and speak and became incontinent having previously achieved continence. Medical records documented cerebellar atrophy on brain imaging. Over time she did regain speech but it was dysarthric. She regained the ability to sit and walk in a limited fashion but gait was very broad based and ataxic. She had multiple falls with injury e.g. broken teeth. From the age of six she has largely mobilised at home by moving on the floor due to severe ataxia. She attended a school for children with physical disabilities. She did learn to read and obtained some basic arithmetic skills but left school without completing any exams. Symptoms were relatively static until the age of 28 when she developed migraine headaches and severe dyspepsia with episodes of vomiting.

Her Moroccan parents were consanguineous (first cousins).
She presented at 37 days of age with paroxysmal abnormal ocular movements consisting of conjugate down-gaze deviation, convergent strabismus and horizontal nystagmus. Her neurological examination was otherwise normal, and a cranial ultrasound disclosed no abnormalities. At 2 months of age, she was admitted to the hospital with vomiting, lethargy alternating with irritability and severe axial hypotonia with increased muscle tone in the four limbs. Cranial tomography showed bilateral and symmetric basal ganglia hypointensity. Brain MRI demonstrated bilateral and symmetric T2 signal hyperintensity in the globus pallidus, putamen, cerebral peduncles, medulla oblongata and cervical spinal cord. Swelling and restricted diffusion of the affected basal ganglia, together with a prominent lactate peak in the magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the left basal ganglia. The patient became less responsive and more hypotonic, despite treatment with biotin and thiamine, and developed an abnormal respiratory pattern leading to progressive respiratory failure requiring ventilator support. She presented with brief generalized seizures that responded well to diazepam, but the progression of symptoms led to her death 5 days after admission.
The plasma lactate levels ranged from 3.9 to 5.8 mmol/L (normal < 2.2) over the 5-day period, and the ratio of plasma lactate to pyruvate was 17 (normal < 25).

701,"A pair of female monochorionic-biamniotic twins was born prematurely at 28 weeks and 6 days of gestation via vaginal delivery due to spontaneous and unstoppable labor. The pregnancy had developed without any reported infectious or familial risk factors, and antenatal care included completed betamethasone treatment. Both twins adapted well postnatally, with Apgar scores of 8 and 10 at 1 and 5 minutes for the first twin (FT), and 6 and 9 for the second twin (ST). Their birth weights were appropriate for gestational age, falling within the 72nd and 85th percentiles, respectively. Physical examination revealed a hemangioma precursor on the right hand and wrist of FT, and a mild, reducible umbilical hernia in ST. Both exhibited camptodactyly. Aside from mild hypoglycemia in ST that required intravenous correction, their perinatal courses were unremarkable.

At discharge, which occurred at 37 weeks and 2 days of postconceptional age, both infants were in good health. However, by 3 months of chronological age, clinical divergence became evident. FT demonstrated regular growth, while ST showed marked weight gain reaching the 97th percentile, along with signs including a wide glabellar nevus simplex, moderate macroglossia, and a progressively enlarging umbilical hernia. No hemihypertrophy was detected. Based on clinical features, ST met the criteria for a diagnosis associated with a methylation disorder, prompting genetic evaluation via methylation-specific multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) analysis of a critical chromosomal region. 

While awaiting results, abdominal ultrasound screening of ST revealed an adrenal cystic mass. Subsequent imaging confirmed the presence of a cystic neuroblastoma, which was successfully removed surgically. Genetic testing identified loss of methylation (LOM) at a specific imprinting control region, confirming the diagnosis in ST. Interestingly, this methylation abnormality was also detected in FT's blood, despite the absence of overt clinical features.

A multidisciplinary team comprising pediatricians, geneticists, oral and maxillofacial surgeons, pathologists, pedodontists, and orthodontists conducted a thorough assessment to determine the most appropriate management strategy.

Ultrasound imaging revealed mild liver and kidney enlargement without other abnormalities, and liver and kidney function tests, including tumor screening markers, were within normal limits. Vital signs and blood sugar levels were normal. Although no molecular testing had been performed, the clinical diagnosis was supported by a scoring system that assigns points based on characteristic features. The patient's total score was 5: two points for tongue enlargement, two for lateralized overgrowth, and one for organ enlargement, confirming the clinical diagnosis.

Due to the functional impairments caused by the tongue enlargement, a surgical tongue reduction procedure was carried out under general anesthesia. The procedure employed was a modified reduction glossectomy using a stellate anterior wedge technique. Histopathological analysis of the excised tissue revealed muscular hyperplasia. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and by the age of 2, the patient showed significant improvement with no difficulties in breathing or speech. Regular follow-ups with his pediatrician were ongoing to monitor organ development and function.","FKM","ICR1	","Yes","Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome","130650","116"," PMID: 34257987 PMCID: PMC8259928 DOI: 10.1002/ccr3.4479",,,,
705,"A 28-year-old woman underwent evaluation at 22 weeks gestation due to an abnormality identified on a prior ultrasonographic (US) scan at another facility. Repeat US scans were obtained at the time of presentation, and follow-up imaging was conducted three weeks later. Biometric measurements showed that the fetal head size and femur length were consistent with gestational age, with appropriate interval growth observed.

Imaging findings revealed a well-defined, membrane-covered defect in the anterior abdominal wall, located centrally at the site of the umbilical cord insertion. This defect was associated with the presence of ascites between bowel loops and the covering membrane. The peritoneal membrane was distinctly outlined internally by ascites and externally by amniotic fluid. Additionally, the placenta appeared markedly thickened, measuring at least 5 cm on the initial scan and approximately 10 cm on follow-up. Multiple cysts were identified within the placenta, with at least one cyst observed initially and five or more noted on the later scan.

706,"A 50-year-old Japanese man had a history of proteinuria since the age of 4 and underwent a kidney biopsy at 8 years old, which confirmed a diagnosis. By 20 years old, he developed sensorineural hearing loss and astigmatism due to lenticular lens abnormalities. He commenced hemodialysis at 22 years old for end-stage kidney disease. At presentation, he was receiving 20 μg of darbepoetin alpha weekly and intravenous iron for renal anemia. For secondary hyperparathyroidism, he was treated with 2.5 mg of intravenous maxacalcitol thrice weekly and 4 mg of oral evocalcet daily. A hearing aid was installed at 48 years old to manage progressive hearing loss.

Genetic testing revealed a hemizygous nonsense variant in COL4A5 (c.2980G > T; p.Gly994Ter), deemed pathogenic per ACMG guidelines. This variant appeared novel as it was not previously documented in ClinVar or the LOVD. His mother, also on hemodialysis, declined genetic testing. Functional studies demonstrated that the mutant COL4A5 protein exhibited reduced extracellular secretion compared to the wild-type protein, as shown via Western blot analysis using HEK293 cells transfected with wild-type and mutant constructs.

At 48 years old, he developed a high-flow arteriovenous fistula (AVF) with a shunt aneurysm, leading to significant exertional dyspnea. Despite reanastomosis and shunt aneurysm resections, the high-flow AVF persisted, and he continued to experience elevated brachial artery blood flow (>4,000 mL/min) and high cardiac output (5,874 mL/min) at 51 years old. Consequently, a surgical banding operation was performed on the radial artery using a polytetrafluoroethylene graft to reduce the blood flow. Post-operatively, brachial artery blood flow decreased to 987–1,236 mL/min, and cardiac output improved to 5,100 mL/min. His shortness of breath subsided, and vascular dilation in the forearm lessened within 3 months following the procedure.","FKM","COL4A5","yes","Alport syndrome 1, X-linked","301050","88917"," PMID: 37928459 PMCID: PMC10620688 DOI: 10.3389/fmed.2023.1227283",,,,

713,"Here is the patient report with all symptoms described while ensuring the disease name remains undisclosed:  

---

A 65-year-old male presented to the emergency department with acute psychomotor agitation and hallucinations following severe chronic sleep deprivation. He had no prior psychiatric history. Since the age of 10, he had experienced persistent discomfort in his legs, characterized by an uncontrollable urge to move, worsening at night. At the time of evaluation, he was on pramipexole 0.75 mg/day. He reported hearing impairment but no significant visual deficits. He had been on peritoneal dialysis before transitioning to hemodialysis for one year. A prior skin biopsy revealed abnormalities in basement membrane structure, and genetic testing identified a specific mutation in a collagen-related gene. His family history was significant, with multiple female relatives exhibiting proteinuria and hematuria despite preserved renal function, while two deceased brothers had severe movement-related complications preventing successful dialysis. His own struggle with involuntary movements had led to multiple peritoneal dialysis failures due to catheter displacement, necessitating the shift to hemodialysis.  

One year prior to the current evaluation, video-polysomnography (v-PSG) demonstrated severe sleep disruption, with sleep efficiency at 64% and a high frequency of involuntary leg movements during sleep. Laboratory tests, including ferritin, transferrin saturation, and vitamin levels, were normal. In the week before admission, the patient developed uncharacteristically aggressive behavior and refused his routine nephrology check-up. His movement disorder had worsened, spreading to his upper limbs and trunk, making it impossible to rest. Attempts to increase his medication dosage had failed. His wife reported frequent sudden sleep attacks, including one that led to a fall and a zygomatic bone fracture. A two-week actigraphy study initially confirmed severe sleep disruption, which improved following a medication adjustment, reducing his symptom severity score.  

One year later, the patient underwent kidney transplantation. During the procedure, his movement disorder treatment was abruptly discontinued, leading to severe agitation that nearly compromised the surgery, requiring opioid administration in addition to his previous medications. Two months post-transplant, his symptoms significantly improved and remained stable over time. A follow-up v-PSG five years after transplantation showed normal sleep efficiency and resolution of involuntary limb movements. At his most recent evaluation, eight years post-transplant, he had well-controlled symptoms with an adjusted medication regimen, including extended-release pramipexole, a transdermal dopamine agonist, and clonazepam.

Examination revealed well-defined ulcers with a yellowish membrane and perioral erythema. The infant was also noted to have an incomplete cleft palate, a ventricular septal defect, and undescended testicles at birth, with planned surgical management. Routine laboratory tests were unremarkable. Initial treatment included topical analgesics and antifungal therapy, alongside modification of oral habits through dental intervention. The ulcers healed within a month, though lip deformity persisted. The family was lost to follow-up until the child was 2.5 years old.

At this age, the child exhibited premature loss of upper and lower primary anterior teeth and significant drooling. Extraoral examination revealed a nasal ulcer with complete loss of the columella, in addition to persistent lip deformity.

Head circumference measured 48 cm, suggesting chronic undernutrition. Multiple self-inflicted injuries were evident on the lips and fingertips. Neurological assessment revealed altered sensorium, frequent episodes of generalized dystonic posturing, and choreoathetosis. Fundus examination showed papilledema.

Initial laboratory investigations, including hematological and biochemical panels, were within normal limits, except for a markedly elevated serum uric acid level of 11 mg/dL. Due to progressive neurological decline, brain imaging was performed, revealing sagittal and left transverse venous sinus thrombosis. A comprehensive stroke workup, including cardiac evaluation and thrombophilia screening, did not indicate any underlying abnormalities. The child was managed with supportive measures to reduce intracranial pressure, anticoagulation therapy, and medications for dystonia and spasticity. A soft fabricated mouth guard was provided to prevent further self-inflicted injuries. Over time, there was an improvement in alertness, seizure control, and resolution of dystonic posturing.","FKM","HPRT1","Yes","Lesch-Nyhan syndrome","300322","510"," PMID: 34507434 DOI: 10.4103/0028-3886.325342",,,,
728,"A 1-year-old infant boy presented with hypotonia, intermittent spasticity, and poor head control. He was born at 39 weeks and 4 days with a birth weight of 3414 g. Clinical evaluation revealed persistent hypotonia interspersed with episodes of spasticity, intermittent neck hyperextension, and poor head control. Additional findings included mild hypotonia of the extremities, muscle strength graded at 4–5, brisk deep tendon reflexes (+++), and questionable bilateral ankle clonus. At 4 months, his mother observed orange-colored crystalline sediment in his diaper. His motor development was significantly delayed, and he was unable to sit or stand independently by 1 year of age.

A family history revealed a maternal uncle with similar neurological symptoms, including psychomotor delay, self-injurious behavior, and episodes of choking. The uncle passed away at the age of 5, preventing further genetic or biochemical analysis. Cardiac evaluation revealed a patent foramen ovale, and brain imaging showed mild enlargement of the subarachnoid spaces, prominence of the lateral and third ventricles, and bilateral frontal horn cysts. Laboratory investigations showed normal blood counts, liver, renal, and thyroid function. Venous blood gas analysis was within normal limits. Metabolic investigations identified elevated plasma total carnitine and hyperuricemia. Genetic testing revealed a splice site mutation in the HPRT1 gene.

729,"A male infant, aged 1 year and 2 months, was born at 39 weeks and 3 days via Cesarean section due to placenta previa, with a birth weight of 3850 g. Postnatally, he exhibited poor weight gain, leading to a diagnosis of renal tubular acidosis type I and nephrocalcinosis, for which sodium bicarbonate supplementation was initiated. His family reported occasional yellowish crystals in his urine, poor sleep quality, and frequent startle reflexes.

At 4 months, he developed seizures requiring multiple hospitalizations and treatment with levetiracetam and clonazepam. Other symptoms included metabolic acidosis, poor appetite, and frequent regurgitation. Physical examination revealed hypotonia with intermittent spasticity and hypermobile joints. Brain imaging and echocardiography were unremarkable, but renal ultrasound at 1 year and 1 month showed bilateral nephrocalcinosis and mild left hydronephrosis. EEG at 1 year and 2 months was normal. Involuntary movements were noted during excitement, leading to treatment with S-adenosylmethionine at 1 year and 3 months.

Metabolic investigations showed abnormalities in renal function, acidosis, reduced plasma total carnitine, and elevations in urine organic acids, including acetoacetic acid, vanillic acid, and sebacic acid. A urinary Benedict’s test was positive, and hyperuricemia was identified. Genetic testing confirmed a hemizygous guanine duplication in the HPRT1 gene, leading to a frameshift mutation.

730,"A 4-year-old male patient presented with clinical features resembling cerebral palsy. He was born at 39 weeks via Cesarean section, with a birth weight of 2500 g. Physical examination revealed dystonia, spasticity, bilateral ankle clonus, disuse muscle atrophy, and joint contractures in both hands and ankles. A self-inflicted wound on the lower lip was noted. Hypotonia was observed between 1 and 3 years of age. He was able to ambulate with a walker by age 5 but developed hypertonia by age 6. He had previously undergone surgical intervention for C1–C2 subluxation, and at age 10, a tracheostomy was performed due to respiratory failure. Developmental milestones were delayed throughout infancy and childhood.

Brain MRI revealed a focal bony fragment at the odontoid process, raising concerns of os odontoideum or an old fracture with possible upper cervical cord narrowing. Additional findings included left-sided mastoiditis, bilateral sphenoid sinusitis, and a brachycephalic skull configuration. Renal ultrasonography identified bilateral nephrolithiasis with multiple kidney stones and a suspected staghorn calculus in the right kidney. Abdominal CT confirmed the presence of bilateral renal stones, bladder stones, and a suspected ureteral stone.

Laboratory investigations showed macrocytic anemia and elevated serum uric acid levels. Enzymatic testing confirmed undetectable HPRT activity. Based on these findings, a diagnosis was established at 12 years of age. Treatment included allopurinol, folic acid, potassium citrate, S-adenosyl methionine, and piracetam. Unfortunately, the patient was lost to follow-up at 24 years of age.

731,"A 4.5-year-old boy was admitted to the hospital with a history of prolonged fever for the past two weeks, dehydration, and failure to thrive. He had previously been hospitalized two years ago due to dystonia, spasticity in the lower extremities, and psychomotor retardation. His physical examination revealed paleness, decreased skin turgor, and deficits in his bottom lip, likely due to self-injurious behavior. Neurologic assessment showed dystonia, hypertonia, spasticity of the lower extremities, increased tendon reflexes, clonus, a positive Babinski reflex, and an abnormal Rossolimo’s sign. His growth parameters were below the third percentile for height, weight, and head circumference. Perinatal history indicated a full-term birth with an uncomplicated delivery to nonconsanguineous parents, and his family history was unremarkable. Laboratory results showed anemia with a hemoglobin level of 6.1 g/dL and hematocrit of 19%. Kidney function tests revealed elevated blood urea nitrogen at 104 mg/dL and creatinine at 1.25 mg/dL, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30 mL/min/1.73 m². Metabolic acidosis was present, with a total bicarbonate level of 15.4 mmol/L. Severe hyperuricemia was noted, with a uric acid level of 21.5 mg/dL. Urinalysis showed a urine density of 1008 and pH 5.5, with 24-hour urine collection revealing polyuria (6-7 mL/kg/h), severe proteinuria (3.874 mg/m²/24 h), hypercalciuria (7 mg/kg/24 h), increased uric acid excretion (493 mg/m²/24 h), and reduced phosphorus reabsorption (65%). Urinary β2-microglobulin was significantly elevated at 7.66 mg/L. Imaging studies showed normal plain abdominal radiography but revealed renal dysplasia and bilateral diffuse pyramid hyperechogenicity on ultrasound, suggestive of medullary nephrocalcinosis. Treatment was initiated with hydration, uric acid-lowering therapy, and bicarbonates to maintain a urine pH between 6.5 and 7. Two months later, renal function remained stable, with uric acid levels reduced by 70% in serum and 54% in urine, while calcium levels normalized. However, persistent glomerular proteinuria was observed. Two years later, the patient developed chronic renal insufficiency, requiring peritoneal dialysis. Unfortunately, disease progression led to renal failure complications, resulting in death one year later.

The second patient, the first patient's male cousin, was evaluated due to similar neurologic symptoms and psychomotor delay. Given the family history, further genetic testing was conducted, confirming the presence of the same genetic mutation. Despite having the same underlying condition, laboratory findings did not indicate renal impairment, and 24-hour urine collection results were within normal limits. Renal ultrasound showed bilateral diffuse pyramid hyperechogenicity, consistent with medullary nephrocalcinosis.

735,"A 7-year-old male presented to the emergency department with his parents due to recurrent self-inflicted injuries, including tongue and lip lacerations. The child had a history of developmental delay, initially diagnosed as cerebral palsy in infancy due to motor impairment. By the age of four, his condition became more concerning when he began engaging in repetitive self-mutilating behaviors, including aggressive biting of his thumb. Neurologic and serologic evaluations were conducted, ultimately leading to a revised diagnosis. Genetic testing confirmed an underlying hereditary condition inherited from the mother. Multiple treatment strategies were attempted to prevent further self-inflicted trauma, including oral and extraoral splints, as well as straight arm restraints, but all proved ineffective. The child’s parents, physically and emotionally exhausted, declined further protective interventions. Upon evaluation, the patient expressed distress over his condition and requested complete removal of his teeth to prevent further injury. He was admitted for surgical repair of soft tissue injuries and underwent extraction of all erupted and developing teeth, except for the maxillary anterior teeth, which were preserved for aesthetic and functional reasons. The procedure was well tolerated without complications.

Approximately four months later, the patient’s twin brother, who exhibited identical symptoms, underwent a similar treatment plan. By the age of eleven, both siblings remained wheelchair-bound due to persistent involuntary movements. They displayed minimal cognitive impairment and had no significant renal complications at that time. Furthermore, they showed no signs of joint inflammation or pain. They continued to receive daily medication as part of their management plan. Importantly, the self-injurious behaviors were no longer fixated on the remaining teeth, allowing them to engage in a specialized educational program.","FKM","HPRT1","Yes","Lesch-Nyhan syndrome","300322","510"," PMID: 7970591 DOI: 10.1016/0030-4220(94)90061-2",,,,
736,"A female patient from a nonconsanguineous Saudi family was referred to the medical genetics clinic at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre due to developmental concerns and multiple systemic abnormalities. She exhibited global developmental delay, characterized by delayed acquisition of motor and speech milestones. Neurological examination revealed hypotonia, mild spasticity, and dystonic movements. She experienced recurrent episodes of involuntary muscle contractions, leading to difficulty with coordinated movement. Cognitive impairment was noted, with poor attention span and difficulty in verbal communication. The patient also had a history of self-injurious behavior, including repeated biting of fingers and lips. Physical examination identified hyperuricemia-related manifestations, including the presence of tophi and a history of nephrolithiasis. Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated bilateral echogenic foci within the renal collecting system, consistent with crystalline deposits. Laboratory findings revealed elevated serum uric acid levels, and biochemical analysis indicated increased purine metabolism byproducts. Genetic analysis identified a heterozygous variant in HPRT1, confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Skin biopsy was obtained, and fibroblast cultures were used for further molecular studies, including quantitative RT-PCR, which showed reduced expression of the affected gene. X-inactivation studies revealed a skewed inactivation pattern in fibroblast-derived DNA.

737,"A 13-year-old boy with severe muscle stiffness and involuntary movements presented with persistent self-injurious behaviors despite multiple treatment approaches. His self-mutilation began at 4 years of age with hand-biting. While he could understand and follow instructions to stop, he quickly resumed the behavior in a compulsive manner. He was followed by psychiatry and managed with gloves and bilateral elbow extension splints to prevent hand-to-mouth movement. At 8 years of age, genetic testing was performed due to the presence of uric acid crystals in his diaper. His self-injurious behaviors, anxiety, and muscle-related symptoms worsened over time despite multiple medication trials, including carbidopa-levodopa, fluoxetine, gabapentin, clonazepam, olanzapine, and oral baclofen. Clonazepam helped reduce anxiety but did not eliminate the behaviors. Additional physical protective measures, such as a mouthguard, pacifier, and oral motor kinesio taping, were attempted with limited success. At 11 years of age, several teeth were removed to reduce lip-biting, but self-injurious behavior persisted. An intrathecal baclofen (ITB) pump was placed, leading to temporary improvement, though self-biting behaviors returned despite increased baclofen dosage, wheelchair modifications, and continued use of elbow splints.

At 11 years of age, botulinum toxin (BoNT) injections were administered into the masseter muscles to address self-mutilation. Using ultrasound and electric stimulation guidance, 40 units of BoNT were injected into the bilateral masseters. The patient tolerated the procedure well without adverse effects. At the six-week follow-up, a reduction in biting was observed, and by 16 weeks, he required only unilateral elbow extension splints instead of bilateral splints. At five months post-injection, symptoms returned, prompting repeated BoNT injections, each yielding 4–6 months of symptom relief. This treatment was repeated several times, consistently leading to a temporary reduction in self-injurious behavior.

BoNT injections were associated with significant functional improvements in speech therapy. Gains included enhanced breath support, volume, articulation, and utterance length, with an increase from one- to two-word phrases to three- to four-word phrases, with some reaching seven words. Speech regression directly correlated with the time elapsed between injections, and re-administration led to renewed improvements. Using the Photo Articulation Test Third Edition (PAT-3) as a screening tool, the patient initially had 46 errors out of 75 possible productions before BoNT injections. After four rounds of treatment over two years, errors decreased to 21 out of 75, with notable improvement in fricative sound production and final consonant articulation.

Feeding also improved following BoNT treatment. After the third injection, he initially experienced a temporary increase in drooling, possibly due to reduced muscle tone. However, three weeks post-injection, improvements were noted in secretion management, chewing, and swallowing, with reduced gagging and coughing. As the BoNT effects diminished over time, feeding difficulties re-emerged.","FKM","HPRT1","Yes","Lesch-Nyhan syndrome","300322","510","

738,"A 12-year-old boy (height: 51 in.; weight: 44 lbs. 1.5 oz. [20.0 kg]; BMI: 11.93 kg/m2) presented with a 1.5-month history of dysuria, hematuria, and pain secondary to nephrolithiasis. The patient had a history of developmental delay, non-verbal learning disorder, and wheelchair dependence. He exhibited self-injurious behavior, including biting and grinding his teeth, which led to the extraction of 10 teeth. To prevent self-harm, the patient wore arm braces and had undergone surgery on his left thumb. Two years prior, he underwent a cystoscopy with bilateral ureteroscopy due to stone formation, and he was stone-free afterward. His mother denied a family history of kidney stones, thromboembolism, or gout. At 18 months old, an organic acid test revealed highly elevated hypoxanthine with a slight elevation of uracil.

Uric acid crystals were intermittently noted in the patient’s diaper, which had significantly increased in recent days. He had been on medication since the age of two, receiving a daily dose of 200 mg. He had never experienced gout and was prescribed potassium citrate.

Diagnostic tests revealed multiple calculi in both kidneys, with the largest measuring 1.8 cm in the right kidney, along with echogenic material in the medullary pyramids bilaterally, suggesting nephrocalcinosis. Urinalysis showed specific gravity = 1.010, pH = 7.0, leukocyte esterase = 500, trace microscopic hematuria, and negative nitrite. A urine culture was negative, and blood uric acid levels were within the normal range. Six separate urinalyses between the ages of 9 and 12 all demonstrated a pH of either 6 or 7.

A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed staghorn calculi in both kidneys, involving all calyces. The patient underwent a right percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) two months after presentation. During hospitalization, he was noted to be anemic and received epogen and iron supplementation. A thrombus developed in the right cephalic vein, and further testing revealed a genetic predisposition to thrombosis with elevated homocysteine levels. Genetic testing for other mutations was negative, and folic acid was initiated.

Seven weeks later, the patient developed aspiration of liquids, gastroesophageal reflux, and markedly delayed gastric emptying, necessitating a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication with gastrostomy tube and open pyloroplasty. He continued to experience nephrolithiasis, with a left renal calculus exceeding 2 cm. A follow-up CT scan confirmed staghorn calculi in the left kidney. Six months after the right-sided procedure, he underwent a left PCNL and nephrostomy tube exchange. A nephrogram revealed a filling defect in the lower pole calyx, possibly representing an organizing blood clot or residual stone. Subsequent renal ultrasounds showed extensive bilateral nephrocalcinosis without hydronephrosis or hydroureter, with no further evidence of calculi in the collecting systems.

The stones removed during the ureteroscopies, those passed naturally, and those analyzed post-PCNL were all found to be consistent with a rare type of calculi formation.","FKM","HPRT1","Yes","Lesch-Nyhan syndrome","300322","510"," PMID: 30001695 PMCID: PMC6043999 DOI: 10.1186/s12887-018-1197-5",,,,

743,"The patient was a 27-year-old pregnant woman, gravida 1 para 0. She and her husband were not consanguineous, and both were usually in good health, with no significant medical history or habits such as smoking and drinking. Routine maternal serologic screening in the first trimester returned negative results for rubella virus, toxoplasma, human immunodeficiency virus, and hepatitis B and C.

At 24+1 gestational weeks, a routine mid-trimester fetal ultrasound revealed that the estimated gestational age of the fetus was 22 weeks and 4 days, with fetal growth parameters showing biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference, and femur length all measuring below the 10th percentile. Notably, cystic structures were observed in the posterior horn of both lateral ventricles, with sizes measuring 8.2 × 6.7 mm on the left and 9.1 × 6.5 mm on the right. Additionally, a single umbilical artery was detected. Fetal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the presence of cystic structures around the bilateral lateral ventricles and abnormal signal foci in the white matter of the right parietal lobe. The fetal brain's sulci and diameters appeared smaller than expected for the gestational age. Amniocentesis and genetic testing were performed, with chromosomal microarray analysis identifying a heterozygous deletion of 23.9 Mb in the chromosome 5q11.1-q21.3 region, classified as a variant of uncertain significance. Testing for intrauterine infections yielded negative results.

Follow-up assessments documented progressive abnormalities. At 28+1 gestational weeks, prenatal ultrasound indicated continued growth restriction, with fetal biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference, and femur length all measuring below the 1st percentile. The cystic structures in the lateral ventricles had increased in size to 12.2 × 9.3 mm on the left and 11.5 × 8.6 mm on the right. MRI findings showed mild ventricular dilation and persistent cystic structures, along with abnormal white matter signals in the right parietal lobe. Sulcal development and overall brain diameter remained behind expected milestones by more than two weeks. Fetal growth restriction was evident, with a progressively reduced growth velocity, particularly affecting biparietal diameter and head circumference, both of which showed severe microcephaly. MRI also indicated signs of delayed nervous system development. Whole-exome genome sequencing later revealed a pathogenic variant affecting the TREX1 gene, inherited in a homozygous state from the parents.

744,"A male baby was born by spontaneous vaginal delivery at 38 weeks of gestation with an Apgar score of 9/9. He was born to consanguineous parents, and his older sister had been diagnosed with cerebral palsy. At birth, his weight was 2.36 kg (3rd centile), head circumference was 32 cm (>3rd centile), and length was 50 cm (50th centile). He presented with subtle dysmorphic features, including a broad nasal base, bilateral epicanthal folds, low-set ears, a high frontal hairline, a small jaw, and frontal obliques. Deep tendon reflexes were normal. An initial impression suggested symmetrical intrauterine growth retardation. Screening for TORCH infections, herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and respiratory syncytial virus was negative. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis and cultures were also negative. Antenatal examination indicated cardiac muscle hypertrophy of all four chambers, an enlarged right atrium, right ventricular hypertrophy, a displaced tricuspid valve, and a dilated small intestine. Postnatal echocardiography identified a small patent ductus arteriosus, a patent foramen ovale, mild right ventricular dilatation with moderate hypertrophy, and a slightly thickened and dysplastic tricuspid valve with minimal regurgitation. Blood analysis revealed thrombocytopenia (platelet count: 43 × 10^9/L) and hypernatremia (152 mmol/L). Coagulation screening was normal. A platelet transfusion increased the platelet count to 112 × 10^9/L, and fluid intake controlled the hypernatremia. During the first week of life, the baby exhibited predominantly tonic seizures. His mother observed episodes of stiffness resembling tonic seizures 3–4 times per day, some accompanied by sudden whole-body movements and bulging eyes lasting up to one minute, followed by postictal sleep. He experienced apnea and increased heart rate during sleep, associated with snoring and sweating, primarily on the neck and forehead.

Neuroimaging performed on the eleventh day of life revealed chronic ischemic changes presenting as cystic encephalomalacia in the bilateral occipital and right parietal lobes, associated with severely narrowed segments of the internal carotid arteries, gracile anterior cerebral arteries, and middle cerebral arteries. Computed tomography (CT) showed cystic encephalomalacia in the parietal and occipital lobes, along with prominent irregular calcifications in periventricular and deep white matter. An electroencephalogram (EEG) demonstrated focal sharp waves in both frontal and temporal regions but no clinical seizures. At two months of age, the infant was irritable, experienced feeding difficulties, and displayed tonic posturing and microcephaly (head circumference: 34 cm). Neurological examination showed hypertonia with brisk reflexes in all extremities. The infant had no head control, could not track objects, and exhibited nystagmus-like eye movements. His eyes did not follow light, and he closed them in response to strong illumination. Whole exome sequencing revealed a homozygous pathogenic variant in the SAMHD1 gene. At three months, EEG revealed interictal sharp waves in both frontal regions, with some epochs of background attenuation lasting 3–4 seconds. Clinically, the baby displayed back arching but did not lose consciousness during events. Some tremulous upper limb movements were noted without EEG changes. Seizures occurred 3–4 times per day, requiring levetiracetam (30 mg/kg/day) for control, while severe spasticity in all limbs was managed with clonazepam and baclofen.

At 11 months, the infant exhibited developmental delay, failure to thrive, recurrent apnea, and cyanosis. He presented with Pierre-Robin-like sequence. Ophthalmologic examination showed bilateral visual inattention, bilateral optic disc pallor, and poor waveforms on visual evoked potential (VEP). The infant did not fixate or follow objects with his eyes. Pupils were round, regular, and sluggish in reaction. Follow-up MRI confirmed worsening cystic encephalomalacia in the bilateral temporal and occipital lobes, diffuse white matter abnormalities, brain volume loss, and periventricular calcifications. Dilated ventricles suggested diffuse brain atrophy. Arterial narrowing observed previously appeared regressed.

At 20 months, microcephaly persisted, along with severe developmental delay (height: 74 cm, <3rd centile; weight: 10.2 kg, <10th centile), spasticity in all extremities, and episodes of abnormal body movements. A nasojejunal tube was inserted due to poor oral feeding. A barium enema revealed a stenotic segment at the recto-sigmoid junction, raising suspicion of Hirschsprung disease. Echocardiography indicated mild left ventricular hypertrophy and mild ascending aorta dilatation. At 34 months, the patient demonstrated severe global developmental delay and failure to thrive. He remained unable to sit, even with support, and exhibited persistent spastic quadriplegia with brisk reflexes. Speech was absent, and no communication skills were developed, including gesticulation. Psychomotor milestones were not achieved. Despite his condition, feeding was well tolerated. A recent echocardiogram confirmed mild left ventricular hypertrophy, moderate ascending aorta dilatation, and normal cardiac function. Ongoing cardiology supervision was required. MRI findings remained stable, showing no new ischemic lesions, preserved cerebral and neck artery flow, and sustained chronic ischemic changes.

756,"Mr. AZ and Mrs. RZ, a healthy Palestinian couple married for the last ten years, presented to a genetic clinic due to a history of recurrent pregnancy losses. Mrs. RZ, a 33-year-old woman with a bachelor's degree in education, and Mr. AZ, a 35-year-old man with a bachelor's degree in science, had experienced two early miscarriages and two neonatal deaths. The deceased infants had congenital heart disease characterized by hypoplastic left heart syndrome, microcephaly, and respiratory distress. Their only living child, a 6-year-old son, exhibits mild intellectual impairment, behavioral challenges, and traits associated with autism spectrum disorder. Despite thorough metabolic and genetic evaluations, including brain MRI and CT scans, no definitive cause was identified for his condition.

Family history revealed that Mrs. RZ has a brother with a metabolic disorder requiring lifelong dietary management and pharmacological treatment. Additionally, her niece, a 2-year-old, was diagnosed with the same condition through newborn screening and is responding well to dietary therapy. Despite this family history, Mrs. RZ had no signs of the disorder; her physical examination was unremarkable, with no dysmorphic features or skin, hair, or eye pigmentation abnormalities. She exhibited no neurological deficits or cognitive impairments, and her academic performance had been normal with no history of learning difficulties or behavioral issues.

Following initial assessments, which included parental chromosomal analysis and maternal hematological and autoimmune testing, the couple was referred for further genetic evaluation. Given the recurrent pattern of a similar phenotype in two neonates, exome sequencing was performed on both parents. After ruling out other potential causes of pregnancy loss, sequencing aimed to identify shared genetic variants that could contribute to the observed cardiac phenotype in their offspring. The analysis revealed that Mrs. RZ carries a specific genetic variant associated with a metabolic disorder. Biochemical testing confirmed markedly elevated levels of a specific amino acid, consistent with an underlying metabolic imbalance.

Upon diagnosis, dietary management was initiated to regulate metabolic levels, and additional pharmacological therapy was considered. Regular biochemical monitoring showed improved levels within the target range. Three months after starting treatment, Mrs. RZ conceived again. Throughout her pregnancy, close biochemical monitoring ensured that her metabolic levels remained within a safe range. Ultrasound evaluations during the first trimester showed no structural abnormalities.","FKM","PAH","yes","Maternal PKU syndrome","261600","2209"," PMID: 37701331 PMCID: PMC10494492 DOI: 10.1002/jmd2.12384",,,,

Physical examination revealed pallor, hepatosplenomegaly and evidence of easy bruising. There was generalized pigmentation and pingueculae. Within three years symptomatic thrombocytopenia developed and thereafter she underwent total splenectomy with rapid correction of the pancytopenia. The patient has also suffered a pathological fracture of the neck of humerus, which healed well, following which she was commenced on bisphosphonate therapy with supplementation of calcium and vitamin D3.","Yanjun liu","GBA","Yes","Gaucher disease","608013","85212, 77259, 77260, 77261, 2072","PMID: 15028849",,,,

772,"Dizygotic twins; D2 was first evaluated at the age of 49 years. Splenomegaly had been noted when he had scarlet fever at the age of six. When 21 years old, the patient had an episode of prolonged bleeding following extraction of a tooth, and was found to be thrombocytopenic. Ten years later, he suffered a presumed episode of splenic infarction with sudden onset of left upper quadrant abdominal pain. This settled spontaneously, but he briefly became jaundiced. 
At the age of 47 years, he suffered avascular necrosis of his right humeral head (Figure 1d), leaving him with a limited range of movement and some residual aching.

On examination, he had numerous bruises and pingueculae. There was marked hepatosplenomegaly. Serological testing confirmed the presence of IgG antibodies to HSV, VZV, EBV and CMV.
