The woman had no neonatal jaundice; however, at the age of 1 year, marked hepatomegaly (2 cm) and splenomegaly (7 cm) were noted. Vacuolated lymphocytes were observed in her blood and cerebrospinal fluid, and many foam cells were observed in the bone marrow. The enzymatic activity of acid sphingomyelinase in skin fibroblasts had decreased to 17 nmol/mg/h (118 53). However, contrary to the expected severe prognosis of known infantile cases, she survived well with minimal neurological symptoms. The patient developed auditory hallucinations, nocturnal urination, and sleep paralysis at the ages of 3, 6, and 9 years, respectively. These symptoms gradually subsided by the age of 12 years. She had an eating disorder between the ages of 17 19 years, and excessive daytime sleepiness appeared at the age of 19 years. Orofacial and oromandibular dystonic movements with facial pain appeared at the age of 27 years. At the age of 28 years, when she was referred to our hospital, she was neurologically intact except for the dystonia. Ultrasonography detected mild unpalpable splenomegaly.",

Childhood acquisitions were normal, but school performances were noted to be poor, because of slow learning, mild difficulties in writing, reading and speaking. However, he could follow a normal educational training. When he was 16 years old, he was hospitalized for an acute paranoid delirium, which resolved after 2 months. Three years later he experienced another acute episode but with persistence of psychotic features suggestive of paranoid. During the following years, he became clumsy with poor upper limbs coordination. Cognitive troubles appeared, including apathy, memory impairment and a dysexecutive syndrome which progressively worsened. At 21 years of age, neurological examination revealed a tetra pyramidal syndrome, gait and limbs cerebellar ataxia, dysarthric speech, dysphagia and VSO. At the age of 24 years, he had lost gait and speech. Dystonic postures involving hands and legs and myclonic jerks appeared. Gastrostomy was performed at 26 years because of severe deglutition problems. Mild cortical and subcortical atrophy were reported on brain MRI.

         "This 40-year-old female had normal psychomotor development, with normal schooling, and worked as an employee in a supermarket. She had two normal pregnancies. When 30 years old, she suffered from an acute persecutive delusion with acoustic hallucinations. Persistent delusion led to the diagnosis of schizophrenia. Despite chronic therapy with neuroleptics and mood stabilizers, she experienced eight delusion relapses in 6 years requiring hospitalizations at each time. She refused medical follow-up for the next 4 years. During this period, in addition to psychotic features, she developed slow dysarthric speech, attention and memory impairment, dysphagia and ataxic gait. At the age of 40 years, neurological examination revealed VSO, gait cerebellar ataxia, pyramidal signs, left upper limb rest tremor and rigidity. Neuropsychological evaluation showed dementia with non-fluent aphasia, apragmatism, anosognosia, perseverations, memory impairment, visuoconstructive apraxia and prosopagnosia. Her gait progressively worsened and at the age of 42 years, she was unable to walk alone. Abdominal ultrasonography disclosed hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. Brain MRI revealed moderate atrophy affecting the cerebral cortex, the cerebellum and the corpus callosum, without signal abnormalities. EEG showed generalized slowing.",

Partial splenectomy was performed at 12 years because of an acute abdominal pain. Lipid analysis of frozen spleen tissue performed by one of us (M.T.V.) revealed a typical pattern and the diagnosis was definitely confirmed later on skin fibroblasts. His psychomotor development was normal and he attended normal school until 15 years old, when his parents and teachers first noticed behavioural disturbances including social isolation, self mutilations, aggressiveness and hyperphagia. A psychiatric evaluation revealed a depressive syndrome. An insulin dependent diabetes mellitus developed at the age of 16 years. Gait abnormalities with falls appeared when he was 19 years old and progressively worsened. At the age of 24 years, behavioural disturbances led to institutionalization. Neurological examination found gait and upper limbs cerebellar syndrome and VSO. Neuropsychological evaluation was not possible. Brain MRI showed mild cortical, subcortical and corpus callosum atrophy with relative sparing of the posterior fossae. He experienced one generalized tonic clonic seizure and frequent sudden falls without loss of consciousness, suggestive of cataplexy. He died at 30 years of age in a bedridden state.

         "This male patient had no familial history. He attended normal school and was employed in a gas company. Splenomegaly was noticed at the age of 3 years, for which a spleen biopsy revealed foam cells. He was also treated for hypercholesterolaemia and, depression and presented deafness which was considered as a sequel of head trauma. He had been followed up for a transient glomerular nephropathy (membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type II) with renal failure. At the age of 34 years, he developed acute delirium with paranoid delusion and dissociative features. Neuroleptic therapy led to partial improvement. On examination, he was alert and well oriented but a pyramidal syndrome was noted. Over the next 4 years, attention deficit and difficulties in finding words worsened. Neuropsychological evaluation, at the age of 38, showed diffuse cognitive alterations, with predominant frontal lobe dysfunction, memory impairment and visuoconstructive apraxia. He rapidly deteriorated within the next months with acute renal failure, acute delirium, dysphagia, cachexia and dehydration, requiring a combination of dialysis, sedative drugs and gastrostomy. He subsequently became catatonic and bedridden with total dependence. Routine laboratory tests, chest radiography and brain MRI were reported to be normal. He died at 39 years of age.",

She also experienced several sudden falls while standing, without loss of consciousness, that were described as a tonus loss and were suggestive of cataplexy. General examination did not show splenomegaly but this was found with ultrasonography. Gait difficulties progressively increased but when 23 years old, she was still autonomous for activities of daily living. CT-scan of the brain was normal. She refused MRI.

She worked successfully in several offices and had two normal pregnancies. When 28 years old, she consulted for deafness but did not complain of other symptoms. A careful neurological evaluation revealed cerebellar dysfunction with ataxic gait, dysmetria, dysarthric speech and VSO. Abdominal ultrasonography showed hepatosplenomegaly. No MRI of the brain was performed. With time, ataxia and dysarthria became more and more invalidating, but her mental capacities remained quite well preserved.

Following a transient documented episode of neonatal icterus, hepatosplenomegaly was found on systematic clinical examination when he was 5 weeks old. During childhood, he presented numerous, spontaneously resolutive infections affecting skin and parotid glands, associated with interstitial neuropathy and persistent elevation of sedimentation rate, suggestive of immunodeficiency. A spleen biopsy revealed sea blue histiocytes but no definite diagnosis was made. When 17 years old, he exhibited abnormal, fixed postures of his hands, progressively followed by increasing gait difficulties. Neurological examination at the age of 18 showed generalized cervical and upper limbs dystonia, gait cerebellar ataxia and VSO. Splenomegaly was present. Cortical and cerebellar atrophy were noticed on a brain CT-scan (no MRI was performed). EEG showed diffuse slow waves. The biochemical examination of a liver biopsy (M.T.V.) showed a lipid storage profile typical of the condition and the diagnosis was confirmed on fibroblasts. Chorea and myoclonus affecting all body parts subsequently appeared, leading to a progressive deterioration of his motor skills. In addition, the cerebellar syndrome increased, and finally he became unable to walk alone at the age of 30. A gastrostomy tube was placed because of increasing dysphagia.

         "This female patient had learning difficulties since childhood because of poor concentration capacities. She also had a tendency to flex her head rapidly to see downward which was interpreted as a tic but which can in retrospect be interpreted as a sign of VSO. At 12 years, she benefited from orthoptic re-education. She could achieve a sales person professional position but with difficulties because of calculation impairment. From the age of 19 years she progressively exhibited dysarthria, cerebellar ataxia, dystonic postures involving fingers and VSO. Abdominal ultrasonography disclosed an isolated splenomegaly. At 20 years of age, the diagnosis was made. She was hospitalized in a psychiatric department for 6 months because of social withdrawal, aggressiveness, persecutive delusion and suicide attempts. These psychiatric troubles were controlled with neuroleptics and at the age of 22 years, the patient is still autonomous for most activities of daily living. A brain MRI showed mild atrophy of the pons and cerebellum but without discernible cortical atrophy. Electroneuromyography was considered normal.",

When 15 years old, a teacher noticed he had difficulties to look downwards. At 17 years he first visited a neurologist who noted a cerebellar syndrome. Abdominal echography showed splenomegaly. The diagnosis was made. Ataxia worsened and at 21 years, he had to use a wheelchair. From 23 years, he also exhibited dysarthria, hand dystonic postures and choreic movements. From 20 years, he started to present acute psychiatric troubles with agitation, aggressiveness, visual and auditive hallucinations and delusion. These episodes occurred at an average rate of once per year, lasting 15 days each time and were well controlled with treatment. MRI could not be performed because of choreic movements.

         "A 23-year-old man presented with two months of exertional dyspnea and cough with progressive malaise and lethargy. He denied any weight gain, swelling, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He was diagnosed at age 9 months and is the only child of fourth cousin parents of Portuguese ancestry. There is no family history of inherited metabolic disease, heart disease, or sudden unexplained deaths. He was initially treated with levo-carnitine, but had stopped taking it for 5 years as he reported unpleasant \"fishy\" body and urine odor. Examination revealed a blood pressure of 115/87 mmHg, a regular heart rate of 122 beats per minute, respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute on room air. The jugular venous pulsation was elevated above the angle of the jaw. His apex was laterally displaced. A normal S1, physiologically split S2, and S3 were auscultated. The remainder of the cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, musculoskeletal, neurological, and dermatological examination was unremarkable. Investigations revealed a normal complete blood count. Brain natriuretic peptide was elevated at 2067 pg/mL and troponin I levels were undetectable. Urinary organic acid analysis by mass spectrometry detected massive amounts of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric and methylglutaconic acids. Serum total free carnitine was 11 mol/L (normal 16 66 mol/L), total carnitine 17 mol/L (normal 25 88 mol/L), and beta-hydroxybutyrate was undetectable. Creatinine kinase and thyroid stimulating hormone were normal. Viral studies were negative. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. Chest radiograph showed an increased cardiothoracic ratio, a small left pleural effusion, and normal pulmonary vascularity and interstitial markings. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging revealed severe left ventricular enlargement (left ventricular end diastolic volume of 354 mL) with an ejection fraction of 15% and an apical thrombus, severe right ventricular dysfunction, severe biatrial enlargement, but no valvular disease. There was no evidence of myocarditis.",

         "A 17-year-old male patient presented to the emergency room acutely ill. Since childhood the patient was fed with frequent carbohydrate rich meals during daytime and with a continuous corn-starch based formula at night administered through a percutaneous gastric feeding tube. The patient s level of metabolic control was suboptimal, and he suffered from severe hepatomegaly, nephromegaly, hyperlipidemia, and short stature. He had been hospitalized several times for severe lactic academia usually associated with fasting or nonadherence to the recommended diet. These episodes responded to treatment with dextrose and bicarbonate infusions. The patient had been feeling ill for at least 7 days and had a 2-day history of nausea, weakness, and dyspnea. He had been unable to eat for several days and had not received his usual nighttime corn-starch based formula. Even though he had felt sick, he had delayed coming to the emergency room or notifying his physicians. Emergency medical personnel who were called to take him to the hospital noted respiratory distress and a blood glucose of 28 mg/dL. During transport, he was given intravenous dextrose. On arrival to the emergency room, the patient appeared dyspneic with a Kussmaul respiratory pattern, pronounced tachycardia, and a state of high anxiety. His blood pressure was 143/78, and rectal temperature was 36.5 C. On physical examination, the patient was highly anxious and diaphoretic and had a firm enlarged liver. Laboratory testing done on admission indicated that the patient s hypoglycemia had been reversed (serum glucose of 133 mg/dL (7.4 mmol/L)), but there was a severe metabolic acidosis (pH of 7.11, HCO3, 4 mEq/L, and pCO2, 12.8 mmHg). The initial serum lactate was 27 mmol/L (normal range 0.5 2.2 mmol/L). Mild renal impairment (creatinine 79 mol/L) and mild leukocytosis were also noted.",

         "A 66-year-old male business manager with past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and intermittent sinusitis was transferred to our tertiary care center for progressive encephalopathy and concern for nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Three weeks prior to admission, he was prescribed a 10-day course of levofloxacin for presumed sinusitis. As cough and postnasal drip did not improve, he was treated with two courses of methylprednisolone in addition to levofloxacin and subsequently clarithromycin. Two days prior to presentation, he developed headaches and sinus pressure and complained about feeling off, epigastric pain, and dry heaving. The night prior to presentation, he awoke frequently throughout the night with progressive confusion. The patient did not have fever, chills, or sweats. His family reported a history of anxiety, panic attacks, claustrophobia, and anger outbursts, with the last notable outburst having occurred about 6 months earlier. Of note, coworkers found a collection of various over-the-counter vitamins and nutritional supplements at the patient s desk. Given increasing confusion and agitation, the patient was taken to another hospital where he became progressively more obtunded, requiring intubation for airway protection. He was empirically started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir for concern of infectious meningoencephalitis. CSF analysis revealed elevated total protein at 53 mg/dL, glucose of 160 mg/dL (serum glucose: 240 mg/dL), no pleocytosis (1 WBC/mm3), negative CSF VDRL, negative West nile virus IgM and IgG, negative cryptococcal antigen, and negative fungal and bacterial cultures. Due to development of teeth grinding and concern for subclinical seizure activity, a routine electroencephalogram (EEG) was performed that revealed no seizure activity, however findings consistent with global cerebral dysfunction. He was started on phenytoin and subsequently on levetiracetam. An MRI of the brain showed chronic mild periventricular white matter hyperintensities but no acute findings. He was transferred to our tertiary care center on hospital day 3 for concern of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. On examination, he was intubated and mechanically ventilated, with no abnormal general physical findings. On neurological examination, he was comatose, with intact brainstem reflexes and extensor posturing in all extremities to central stimulation. Initial laboratory work was notable for normal liver function panel, serum ammonia 120 g/dL (reference range 65 107 g/dL), and negative hepatitis panel, as well as respiratory alkalosis. Repeat CSF analysis showed 3 WBC/mm3 (76% neutrophils), 1 RBC/mm3, lactic acid 2.6 meq/L, total protein 28.5 mg/dL, and negative herpes simplex virus PCR as well as negative enterovirus panel, and acyclovir was discontinued. Treatment with lactulose was begun, but serum ammonia rapidly rose to 494 g/dL within a few hours of arrival to our hospital. Rifaximin and L-carnitine were added, and emergent hemodialysis was initiated. An MRI of the brain on day of transfer showed extensive areas of restricted diffusion with associated FLAIR hyperintensity involving bilateral temporal lobes and bilateral insular, bilateral frontal, and parietal regions in cortical and subcortical areas and diffuse mild effacement of the cerebral sulci, without enhancing lesions. Continuous electroencephalogram (cEEG) for a duration of 96 hours showed continuous, irregular, generalized low voltage slowing; however, intermittently observed facial and lip twitching did not have an electrographic correlate on cEEG. The MRI findings of symmetric grey matter involvement in the abovementioned areas, and in absence of hypoxic-ischemic insult and seizure activity, were deemed most consistent with hyperammonemic encephalopathy. The patient underwent continuous venous hemofiltration for two consecutive days followed by regular hemodialysis for two days, with sustained corre",

At 17 months, hepatosplenomegaly was noted and a bone marrow biopsy led to the diagnosis of type 3. He began enzyme replacement therapy (Imiglucerase, 120 U/kg biweekly), with significant resolution of his organomegaly. On examination, he had mild hepatosplenomegaly, bilateral pes cavus, externally rotated hips, genu valgus, hammertoes, decreased muscle tone, and mild foot drop. Reflexes were depressed in the upper extremities and absent in knees and ankles. Ophthalmologic evaluation revealed nystagmus, dysconjugate gaze, slowed, hypometric horizontal saccades, and decreased pupillary constriction (Adie-like).

         "A female patient born at term, weighing 2900 grams, APGAR (appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration) 9-9-10, with no prenatal history, presented neonatal pneumonia at two days of life, for which she was hospitalized for seven days, with complete recovery. The parents were apparently healthy, had no relevant medical history, and denied any blood relationship between them. She did not present intercurrences until she was two years old. Since two years of age, the patient presented episodes of repetitive vomiting with moderate to severe dehydration, was treated in other hospitals in the country, and presented a complete recovery. Between each episode, the patient was asymptomatic and in good health. At three years of age, the patient was admitted to the emergency room of the San Bartolom Hospital in Lima, Peru, with a 10-hour illness, for presenting repeated vomiting, approximately 10 (1/4 cup), of food content, associated with drowsiness, with no other symptomatology. It should be noted that prior to her admission, the patient had a nutritional diagnosis of exacerbated chronic malnutrition. However, her psychomotor and neurological development were appropriate for her age. An arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis was performed, showing metabolic acidosis. A urine test was also performed showing ketonuria 1+. Metabolic acidosis was corrected, and the patient was treated with intravenous fluids and antiemetics. During her hospitalization, bilious vomiting persisted, but less frequently. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed in another health facility, with a diagnosis of esophagitis and erosive gastritis. Likewise, brain magnetic resonance imaging with contrast with 3D spectroscopy was performed, in which no pathological findings were evidenced. Five days after admission, the patient was found to have bradycardia and was also found to be excessively drowsy; the last episode of vomiting was recorded two days before this event. Laboratory tests were performed and showed respiratory alkalosis and low sodium and potassium levels (Table 1). Due to electrolyte disturbances, bradycardia, and excessive drowsiness, the patient was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). The patient was on mechanical ventilation for four days. During her stay in the PICU, she was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection, with a positive urine culture for Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae. In addition, a chest X-ray was performed and alveolar infiltrate was observed in the right hemithorax and left apex. In addition, clonic movements of the upper limbs were reported, so an electroencephalogram was performed, with normal results and no evidence of epileptogenic foci. The patient was evaluated by a pediatric endocrinologist and geneticist who recommended testing for pyruvate, ammonium, lead, lactic acid, and beta-hydroxybutyrate, all of which turned out to be within normal limits.",

         "The first child is a female born at 37 weeks of gestation by ventouse delivery from consanguineous parents from Pakistan. Pregnancy and delivery were uneventful. Growth parameters were normal. Early developmental milestones were age-appropriate in all domains, although she tired quickly when she first started to walk. At the age of five, she developed viral gastroenteritis. Subsequent blood tests revealed her ALT level was six times higher than the normal range (Figure 2). Subsequent ALT monitoring showed a persisting increase after the resolution of the intercurrent illness, triggering investigations for infectious, autoimmune, and metabolic etiologies. This revealed isolated plasma hypermethioninemia at 985 mol/L (normal 10 60) and high urine methionine/creatinine ratio at 46 mol/mmol (normal 3 10), mildly elevated plasma homocysteine level 15 mol/L (normal 5 10), and elevation of muscle enzymes with elevated ALT 250 IU/L (normal 5 25) and high CK 1450 IU/L (normal <250). Indicators of chronic liver failure were observed, with mildly low albumin level 36 g/L (normal 37 56) and a normal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level. Notably, coagulation abnormalities, which are frequently seen in SAHH deficiency, were also present, as evidenced by a prolonged PT of 19.8 s (normal 9.6 11.8) and low fibrinogen levels of 0.8 g/L (normal 1.7 4.0) (Figure 2). Despite these biological abnormalities, the clinical examination was unremarkable. Specifically, there were no clinical signs suggesting coagulation abnormalities. Additionally, there was an absence of visceromegaly, normal muscular strength (including a negative Gowers test), and a standard neurological examination. A formal neuropsychological assessment using the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children (WISC-V) showed good motivation, concentration, and intellectual abilities in the low average range. However, she produced an uneven profile, with weaker abilities in verbal reasoning abilities (below average) and strengths in processing speed (high average). The child attends mainstream school with no difficulties with academic tasks and physical exercise at age 9. Growth was appropriate with weight on the 9th centile and height on the 25th centile. 12 leads ECG, echocardiography, and liver ultrasound were normal. Her brain MRI showed mild leukodystrophy with confluent hyperintense white matter signal changes predominantly involving the deep and subcortical white matter, sparing the extreme subcortical, periventricular, and parts of deep white matter (Figure 3). A muscle MRI showed only a minimal bilateral streaking of the posterior compartment muscles, especially involving the adductor Magnus.",

The elevated ALT could also be related to muscle involvement, as evidenced by a high CK 1125 IU/L (normal <250). Additionally, he had elevated SAM 2730 nmol/L (normal 55 116) and SAH 2550 nmol/L (normal 9 45) levels. AFP was within the normal range.

         "A full term, female infant was born to a G1P0 mother whose fetal ultrasound was concerning at 27 weeks gestation. The newborn had a normal clinical exam with normal muscular tone, and postnatal ECG showed mild hypertrophy of the interventricular septum. Electrocardiogram (EKG) was notable for a very short PR interval, ventricular pre-excitation, and high ventricular voltages. At 2 days of life, GAA enzyme level was low at 1.5 nmol/mg protein (normal 6 37 nmol/mg protein) on leukocyte-based assay at a local lab, urine (E)-hex-4-en-1-yl butyrate (HEX4) was elevated at 34 nmol/mol (normal <19 nmol/mol creatinine), and creatinine kinase was elevated at 2261 IU/L (normal 38 174 IU/L). Given this presentation, suspicion was high. Biopsies of skeletal muscle and skin were obtained, and ERT with alglucosidase alfa was promptly started while waiting for biopsy results to determine CRIM status. Echocardiography at age 3 months no longer showed hypertrophy of the intraventricular septum, but the mitral valve was thickened and tethered by shortened chordae. There was moderate mitral regurgitation and subsequent moderate left ventricular dilation, for which captopril was started. The patient remained on ERT, with normalization of creatinine kinase and urine HEX4 but demonstrating failure to thrive and mild developmental delay. As the clinical picture and cardiac findings did not fit, skin fibroblast GAA level using maltose as substrate was performed, which measured at 1.8 mol/min/mg protein, which was 8.82% of the normal control (control mean = 20.4 2.3 mol/min/mg protein) and not consistent. GAA sequencing subsequently identified a single common late-onset heterozygous mutation (c. -32-13 T > G). DNA microarray analysis was negative for a large deletion of the GAA gene in trans. Biochemical analysis of the skeletal muscle biopsy showed normal glycogen content of 0.49% (control 0.94 0.55%) and low normal GAA activity of 0.2 mol/min/g tissue (control 0.42 0.20 mol/min/g tissue). Subsequently, blood GAA enzyme activity was tested after stopping ERT for a few months; as it measured in the low normal range (6.13pmo/punch/h; control = 10.88 pmol/punch/h), it further ruled out the diagnosis. Light microscopic examination of skeletal muscle showed mild myopathic changes, including increased variation in fiber diameter, a mild increase in lipid, and slightly increased amounts of cytoplasmic glycogen. No rimmed vacuoles were seen, and electron microscopy found no membrane-bound glycogen, so there was no support for a lysosomal glycogen storage disorder. Given these results, the diagnosis was no longer supported. Blood was sent for a commercially available panel, and a heterozygous mutation in PRKAG2 (c.1423A > G p. Lys475Glu) was identified. This was a novel missense mutation predicted to be disease causing for PRKAG2 cardiac syndrome, as it leads to a nonconservative amino acid substitution, occurs at a highly conserved position in the gene, is not a known benign polymorphism, and mutations affecting nearby codons (Tyr487His and Asn488Ile) have been described as disease causing. Echocardiogram (ECG), electrocardiogram (EKG), and PRKAG2 genetic testing were normal in both parents, indicating a de novo mutation in their daughter. The patient was diagnosed with PRKAG2 cardiac syndrome with a carrier status, and ERT was stopped at 8 months of age. Creatinine kinase and urine HEX4 levels were followed for 1 year after stopping ERT and remained normal. Follow-up ECGs continued to show thickened mitral valve leaflets with shortened chordae and moderate mitral valve regurgitation with left ventricular dilation but no ventricular hypertrophy. At 5 years of age, the child continues on captopril for afterload reduction, but she remains asymptomatic from a cardiovascular standpoint and has no overt musculoskeletal weakness per report from the treating physician.",

         "A full-term female infant had wheezing at 5 weeks of age and failed bronchodilator therapy for presumed reactive airway disease. At 11 weeks of age, she presented with more severe wheezing at her pediatrician's office, which prompted referral to the emergency room. Chest X-ray showed severe cardiomegaly, and an ECG demonstrated severe biventricular hypertrophy, severe mitral regurgitation, and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. EKG showed biventricular hypertrophy, a short PR interval, and interventricular conduction delay. She was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit where she was started on milrinone, oxygen, and furosemide for heart failure. She developed persistent ventricular ectopy, which required a lidocaine infusion. Suspicion for was high, but blood GAA enzyme activity level was normal at 15.8 pmol/punch/h (normal 10.88 pmol/punch/h), and GAA gene sequencing and urine HEX4 were also normal. Because of the care team's experience with PRKAG2 cardiac syndrome in the patient described in case 1, this was high in the differential diagnosis. Blood was sent for a commercially available familial HCM panel, which showed a disease-causing mutation in the PRKAG2 gene (c.1592G > A p. Arg531Gln). The patient had persistent arrhythmias and poor cardiac function requiring high-dose inotropy and was therefore listed for cardiac transplant at 3 months of age. She remained in the hospital on milrinone infusion awaiting transplant, but her clinical status continued to decline. At 4 months of age, she had an episode of cardiac arrest requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) cannulation. She then developed severe renal dysfunction, a large right intracerebral hemorrhage presumably from anticoagulation required for ECMO, and was unable to recover any meaningful cardiac function.

         "A previously healthy, full-term, male infant was noted to have hypotonia, areflexia, and generalized weakness at 2 months of age. Over the next several months, he continued to show generalized weakness and developed recurrent respiratory infections with frequent hospital admissions. Evaluation during these admissions showed creatinine kinase mildly elevated at 197 IU/L (normal 38 174 IU/L) and blood enzyme level (done at the local facility) was low at 4.81 U (18.66-U control sample). ECG showed mild hypertrophy of the interventricular septum but an otherwise normal left ventricular mass. EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm without evidence of pre-excitation or hypertrophy. Due to his persistent hypotonia, muscle weakness, and low enzyme level, he was diagnosed with nonclassic at 11 months of age and started on ERT with alglucosidase alfa. After just 3 months of ERT, the patient showed significant improvement in motor skills; he could crawl well, sit unassisted, and pull to a standing position none of which he could do prior to starting ERT. At 2.5 years of age, he had a normal gait and could jump and climb stairs. The previously noted hypertrophy of the interventricular septum resolved, and he had no abnormalities on ECG or EKG. Given the patient's unusual course and atypical presentation for, additional testing was performed at 2.5 years of age. Enzyme testing on skin fibroblasts was normal at 50.7 nmol/h/mg (control 45 180 nmol/h/mg). Gene sequencing identified a heterozygous mutation (c. -32-13 T > G), consistent with being a carrier of. Parental testing showed the same heterozygous mutation in his mother and no abnormalities in his father. These new data no longer supported a diagnosis of, and ERT was discontinued. To identify the true cause of his myopathy, further testing was performed. At age 3, he underwent a quadriceps muscle biopsy that showed mild myopathic features on light microscopy, including increased variation in fiber size, focal myocyte degeneration, a mild increase in cytoplasmic glycogen and other intermyofibrillar material, and subsarcolemmal blebs of uncertain composition. No rimmed vacuoles were seen, and electron microscopy showed no membrane-bound glycogen, which argued against a lysosomal glycogen storage disease. Finally, a glycogen storage disease sequencing panel showed a pathogenic mutation in PRKAG2 (c. 298G > A p. Gly100Ser), a known disease-causing mutation. The patient, now 7 years old, was restarted on ERT just before his fourth birthday due to worsening muscle weakness when off ERT. He continues to make progress in gross motor skills and has some fine motor delays, but there is no further evidence of HCM or pre-excitation.",

         "The patient was seen for the first time at the age of 9 years as an outpatient in the division of paediatric cardiology. The boy s somatic development was normal, but his speech and intellectual development were slightly below age-appropriate limits, prompting special schooling. According to his mother he showed sweating and dyspnoea at exertion, but was otherwise asymptomatic. Auscultation revealed a split first heart sound and a rough systolic ejection murmur over the third left intercostal space. Blood pressure was 105/57. The electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm, incomplete right bundle branch block, and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy; echocardiography disclosed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. Due to further progression of the condition with mitral valve insufficiency, massive obstructive cardiomyopathy affecting both ventricles, and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, the boy was listed for heart transplantation, which was performed at the age of 12.6 years. A muscle biopsy was performed prior to transplantation. Biochemical investigations of the muscle tissue revealed normal activities excluding disorders of the mitochondrial energy metabolism. The possibility of a specific condition was substantiated by immunohistochemistry. Almost 2 years after transplantation the boy did not show episodes of organ rejection. Ophthalmic examination revealed myopia, peripheral pigmentary retinopathy, and lenticular opacities.",

         "A girl, the fourth child of consanguineous parents (first cousins), was born at 38 weeks of gestation after a pregnancy complicated by polyhydramnios. Birth weight was 2180 g (< 3rd percentile), length 47 cm ( 10th percentile), head circumference 30 cm (< 3rd percentile), and APGAR score 8/9. One brother, born at term, and one premature sister, had both died 6 h (presumed perinatal asphyxia) and two days (cause not reported), respectively, after birth. Ultrasound images of the fourth child showed agenesis of the corpus callosum and mild bilateral pyelocaliceal dilatation. At physical examination, dysmorphic features were noted, such as hypertelorism, overriding sutures, hooked nose, micrognathia, camptodactyly of the fifth finger, single transverse palmar crease on the left hand and postaxial polydactyly on the right hand. Immediately after birth and during the following 17 days, she presented with hypoglycemic episodes difficult to control (glucose: 20 40 mg/dl). Laboratory exams, performed during one of these episodes, showed lactic acidemia (4.0 mol/ml; N: 0.7 2.5 mol/ml), mild hyperammonemia, and marked metabolic acidosis (pH 7.20; pCO2 25.1 mmHg; HCO3- 9.6 mEq/L; BE -17.5 mEq/L). Neurologic exam, performed at 4 days of life, showed incomplete Moro reflex, posture of limbs flexion, reduced axial tonus, and slightly elevated appendicular tonus. At 6 days of life, antibiotics were administered for one week due to suspicion of sepsis. On the seventh and 25th days, two samples of urine and one of plasma were collected and sent for inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) screening. Amino acid analyses were carried out on a Biochrom 20 (Biochrom Ltd., Cambridge, UK) amino acid analyzer. Sample preparation and analysis were performed according to the manufacturer s standard protocols. General aminoaciduria was observed and some plasma amino acids were also altered. Urinary organic acid analyses by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) showed massive excretion of fumaric acid (> 232 mmol/mol creatinine, normal range < 45 mmol/mol creatinine). The same result was presented by a new urine sample collected at 40 days of life. At 1 month of age, despite breast feeding and normal sucking, the baby had extreme difficulty gaining weight, remaining undernourished due to persistent vomiting and occasional diarrhea. Cholestatic jaundice and hepatomegaly were noted since birth. At 40 days of life, the following hepatic enzymes were altered: aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 137 U/L, N 10 34 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 78 U/L, N 5 35 U/L; alkaline leukocyte phosphatase (ALP) 267 U/L, N 20 140 U/L, and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase ( GT) 505 U/L, N 0 51 U/L. Further exams at this period revealed colpocephaly [cranial computed tomography (CT)], infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis [abdominal ultrasound (US)] and interatrial communication (ECO). At one-and-a-half months of age, pyloromyotomy was performed, but vomiting episodes persisted. At this time, she still presented with lactic acidemia (5.0 mol/ml), metabolic acidosis, and mild hyperammonemia. Hemotransfusion was performed due to anemia. At 2 months and 4 days, hemoculture was positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis, and she was treated with antibiotics for 14 days. There was a small weight gain, but hepatic enzymes remained altered. At 3 months and 5 days, the girl was discharged but continued to gain weight slowly, although being fed with breast milk and supplementary formula. Vomiting episodes twice a day and occasional diarrhea persisted. At 4 months and 9 days, she was readmitted owing to vomiting with traces of blood, hyperpyrexia, intense crying and pallor, dyspnea, and dehydration. Besides hepatosplenomegaly, she presented with severe metabolic acidosis (pH 6.45; pCO2 32 mmHg; HCO3 2 mEq/L; BE 32 mEq/L) and bradycardia, which evolved to cardiac arrest and death. It was not possible to measure enzymatic activity and perform further tests.",

         "A 51-day-old male infant presented with poor sucking, abdominal distension, and testicular edema. He was the first child of non-consanguineous parents. His father was healthy and his mother had a history of atrial septal defect. He was born without complications at 39 weeks and 6 days, was 50 cm (+0.49 standard deviation (SD)) in length, and weighed 3168 g (+0.38 SD). Newborn mass screening (NBS) using tandem mass spectrometry revealed no abnormalities. He was referred to a local general hospital owing to the development of ascites, liver atrophy, and liver tumor, and was suspected of liver failure resulting from an inherited metabolic disorder. He received mitochondrial rescue therapy including vitamin B1, carnitine, and coenzyme Q10. Moreover, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), antithrombin III, albumin, and vitamin K were administered because of a coagulation disorder. However, treatment for liver failure and the coagulation disorder did not lead to a significant improvement. The patient was transferred to our institution because of the need for LT. He appeared sick, presented with drowsiness, and was jaundiced with the following vital signs: body temperature, 39.7 C; blood pressure, 140/125 mmHg; respiratory rate, 35 breaths/min; pulse, 190 bpm at a regular cardiac rhythm; and oxygen saturation, 90% with oxygen at 2 L/min. Subcutaneous hemorrhage and purple spots were seen scattered from the hypogastric region to the scrotum. He was intubated and his breathing was managed with a ventilator. Laboratory tests revealed anemia (hemoglobin: 7.1 g/dL), thrombocytopenia (platelets: 9.6 10^4/ L), hypoproteinemia (total protein: 4.6 g/dL), and coagulopathy (prothrombin time (PT): 32.6 s (reference: 11.0 15.2 s), PT-international normalized ratio: 2.73 and activated partial thromboplastin time: 51.4 s (reference: 25.2 35.2 s)). Liver function tests revealed unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin: 3.2 mg/dL, direct bilirubin: 0.8 mg/dL). The blood alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level was very high (196,931.0 ng/mL). Administration of FFP, antithrombin III, albumin, and vitamin K was continued. The patient underwent combination therapy with PE and CHDF, and ascitic fluid was removed using continuous drainage. Moreover, he received antibiotic therapy with aminobenzylpenicillin and clindamycin following ceftriaxone sodium hydrate and vancomycin hydrochloride owing to Staphylococcus agalactiae or group B Streptococcus infection in the blood. Urine organic acid analysis demonstrated significantly increased levels of SA and tyrosine metabolites (p-hydroxyphenyl lactic acid [PHPLA] and p-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid [PHPPA]). Moreover, the analysis revealed increased levels of lactic acid, pyruvic acid, phenyllactic acid, phenylpyruvic acid, and phenylacetic acid. Blood amino acids analysis showed increased methionine (448.0 mol/L [reference value: 18.9 40.5 mol/L]), tyrosine (205.9 mol/L [reference value: 40.4 90.3 mol/L]), and phenylalanine (115.2 mol/L [reference control: 42.6 75.7 mol/L]) levels. He was diagnosed with an inherited metabolic disorder and received NTBC (2 mg/kg/day) and tyrosine- and phenylalanine-free formula. NTBC treatment lowered blood AFP levels (36,252.0 ng/mL and 11,386.0 ng/mL at 2 days and 6 days after NTBC treatment, respectively). However, the coagulation disorder showed no signs of improvement. The liver mass in segment VI showed a tendency to expand, and other multiple masses appeared in the liver. He underwent living donor LT from his mother and was recovered from ALF. Blood gene analysis revealed compound heterozygous mutations NM_000137.4(FAH):c.782C > T (p.Pro261Leu) (a previously reported pathogenic variant allele), c.565G > A (p.Val189Ile), and c.688C > G (p.Leu230Val) (novel likely pathogenic variant) in FAH. In addition, NM_000137.4(FAH):c.565G > A (p.Val189Ile) (a previously reported likely nonpathogenic allele) was also identified. The patient was definitively diagnosed with an inherited metabolic disorder.",

         "She was born without complications at 40 weeks and 3 days of gestation, was 50 cm (+0.77 SD) in length, and weighed 3656 g (+1.60 SD). The SA level in the amniotic fluid at 16 weeks' gestation was 0.13 mol/L (ten times less than those of patients with the condition, although ten times higher than those of healthy controls). The infant was treated at the neonatal intensive care unit for neonatal hypoglycemia and discharged at the age of 7 days. NBS showed mildly increased methionine levels in the dried blood spots. Postnatal urine examination for organic acids did not show increased SA levels and blood tests revealed no abnormalities. She was considered an obligate carrier of the condition because she did not present any signs or symptoms related to the condition at the age of 2 months. She achieved normal growth and development after 7 months of routine medical examination. At the age of 9 months, the child was brought to a local general hospital because of changes in skin color and rashes. Blood tests showed mild liver disorder (aspartate aminotransferase, 61 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase, 41 IU/L; lactate dehydrogenase, 418 IU/L; -glutamyl transpeptidase, 134 IU/L; cholinesterase, 191 IU/L; type IV collagen, 607 ng/mL; hyaluronic acid, 100 ng/mL; and AFP: 8349 ng/mL), hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol: 292 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: 188 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol: 58 mg/dL, triglyceride: 100 mg/dL), and elevated methionine (254.1 mol/L) and tyrosine (464.9 mol/L) levels. Ultrasonography revealed a regenerating 14-mm nodule-like mass. She visited our hospital again with suspected condition. She did not develop jaundice, hyperammonemia, coagulation disorder, or electrolyte imbalance. Abdominal ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced MRI revealed dull edges and irregular rough surfaces of the liver, which indicated the possibility of hepatic cirrhosis. Multiple masses in the liver were considered regenerating nodules. The patient was clinically diagnosed with the condition and received NTBC treatment (1 mg/kg/day). Urine organic analysis revealed high levels of PHPLA, PHPPA, and succinyl acetoacetate. At 10 days and 2 months after NTBC treatment, the AFP level was ameliorated to 2380 ng/mL and 82.4 ng/mL. The NTBC dose was increased to 12 mg/day (2 mg/kg/day) from the first dose of 4 mg/day (1 mg/kg/day). She was definitively diagnosed with the condition owing to the detection of the same mutations in the FAH gene as her brother. At the age of 2 years and 6 months, she has a stable life without kidney injury, developmental delay, or growth delay (height: 88.5 cm (+0.04 SD), weight: 13.5 kg (0.96 SD)). The urine SA was negative (0.1 g/mgCr; control <0.5) after receiving NTBC (1 mg/kg/day) and tyrosine and phenylalanine-free formulas.",

         "A 20-month-old girl was referred to pediatric ward at Shahid Sadoughi hospital due to anorexia, recurrent vomiting, and progressive respiratory distress following a viral respiratory infection. She had previously been hospitalized on the second day of birth due to tachypnea and at 11 months old because of hypoglycemia and metabolic acidosis and elevated liver enzymes following gastroenteritis. She had normal development. She was born out of consanguineous marriage. On examination, she weighed nine kilograms (5%) and had severe respiratory distress and hepatomegaly (Liver span: 9 cm). Her laboratory data is presented in Table 1. In urine organic acid test: Lactic acid (754 mmol/molcr, NL<60), Glycerol-3-phosphate (186 mmol/molcr, NL<13) were increased while glycerol was normal. This pattern is suggestive of deficiency. Genetic studies confirmed this diagnosis. Patient with suspected hereditary metabolic disease was treated with serum DW10% (1.5 times preservative fluid), intravenous bicarbonate, and antibiotics after sending in metabolic tests. Given the high blood sugar during treatment, intravenous insulin was prescribed at a dose of 0.05 Iu/Kg/hour. The patient's acidosis ameliorated after 12 hours (VBG: pH 7.31, HCO3 15, PCO2 30) but she still had respiratory distress and was dependent on oxygen. Increased respiratory distress, cyanosis, decreased arterial oxygen saturation and progressive lung involvement resulted in the intubation of the patient be connected to a ventilator. According to the infectious consultation, the patient was prescribed antibiotics. Echocardiography reported right and left heart failure (EF = 30-35%) and appropriate management was undertaken for heart failure. Pulmonary edema (White lung) was reported on chest x-ray due to respiratory infection and unfortunately the patient expired.",

The patient also exhibited extensive Mongolian spots and had been previously treated with antibiotics due to a suspicion of sepsis. Physical examination revealed excessive sweating of the palms and reduced movement in both the upper and lower limbs. The patient experienced multiple episodes of fever and dyspnea, each lasting approximately one minute. Cranial ultrasonography indicated periventricular hyperechogenicity, while echocardiography revealed a 4 mm atrial septal defect. Other metabolic investigations returned normal results. At the age of one year, during a telephonic follow-up, the child was still experiencing feeding difficulties but showed progress in reaching developmental milestones. Exome sequencing identified a novel homozygous four base pair deletion, c.828_831delCCGA, in exon 5 of the CRLF1 gene (ENST00000392386.3), leading to a premature truncation of the protein at codon 276 (p.Tyr276Ter).

         "A 26-year-old male presented with recurrent symptoms of lower limb fatigue, lumbago, nausea, vomiting, and transient unconsciousness following exercise or high-protein meals, with onset at age 22. Physical examination revealed no neurological deficits, but laboratory tests indicated significantly elevated blood ammonia (98.9 mol/L) and reduced ceruloplasmin (0.144 mol/L). MRI of the brain showed symmetrical abnormalities in the basal ganglia. Despite dietary interventions that temporarily alleviated symptoms, he later developed severe gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms, including dyspnea and chest tightness. Blood gas analysis indicated metabolic acidosis (pH 7.007), and elevated troponin and brain natriuretic peptide levels suggested cardiac involvement. The patient ultimately succumbed despite treatment. Biochemical tests revealed elevated propionyl carnitine and urinary metabolites consistent with, confirming the diagnosis.

         "A 34-year-old female, first visited our clinic at the age of 5 in 1989. Previous clinical records until 1992 are unavailable, but a summary indicated congenital nystagmus. She had been diagnosed with [REDACTED] and hyperopia at another clinic and had been wearing glasses since age 3. At her initial visit to our clinic, hyperopia was confirmed. Fundus photographs from that time revealed symmetrical inferior-dominant retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) mottling without bone spicule pigmentation. By 1992, her best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 0.05 (S +6.0) in the right eye and 0.06 (S +5.0) in the left. She had horizontal nystagmus and photophobia and failed the panel D15 test. Anomaloscope testing in 1996 was unmeasurable. By 1998, her bright-flash electroretinography (ERG) was severely attenuated, and 30 Hz flicker ERG was non-recordable in both eyes. At her final clinic visit in 2019, her BCVA had declined to 0.02 (uncorrectable) in the right eye and 0.03 (uncorrectable) in the left. Over the years, fundus photographs documented progressive retinal degeneration and the development of bone spicule pigmentation. Although visual field assessments suggested steady afferent constriction, nystagmus complicated measurements. Autofluorescence imaging revealed donut-shaped retinal degeneration in both eyes. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) performed in 2015 showed that the outer nuclear layer (ONL), ellipsoid zone (EZ), and interdigitation zone (IZ) were preserved in the foveal area, though the preserved region was smaller compared to her sibling. She exhibited no systemic complications.",

At admission, the patient presented with bradycardia and hypothermia (95.4 F) and was treated with intravenous fluids. Routine biochemistry testing indicated mild metabolic acidosis (total CO2, 16.6 mmol/L; reference interval, 21 29 mmol/L) and an anion gap of 23 mmol/L. Plasma ammonia was high (168 mol/L; reference interval, <90 mol/L) and rose further within a few hours to 445 mol/L, requiring therapy with sodium phenylacetate/sodium benzoate (Ammonul). No unusual odor was noted from the child or the child's urine. Follow-up plasma acylcarnitine analysis by tandem mass spectrometry confirmed the increased C5 (10.98 mol/L; reference interval, <0.30 mol/L). Moreover, to identify the specific defect, a urine sample was sent for organic acid analysis by GC-MS and for acylglycine analysis by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.",

Her condition, which began around the age of 40, led to severe muscle atrophy in the lower limbs, with a more pronounced effect on proximal and flexor muscles. Facial and upper extremity muscles were also affected but to a lesser degree. Laboratory tests indicated slightly elevated serum creatine kinase levels, while a muscle biopsy showed almost no adenosine monophosphate deaminase (AMPD) activity. Genetic analysis identified two novel missense mutations (R388W and R425H) in the AMPD1 gene.

The infant was born healthy at term to non-consanguineous parents and initially had normal physical examination findings. Jaundice and tachypnea developed on the second day of life, followed by lethargy and severe metabolic acidosis. Laboratory tests revealed elevated blood ammonia levels and hemolytic anemia with indirect hyperbilirubinemia. Notably, metabolic screening indicated increased glutamic acid and significant excretion of 5-oxoproline. As the condition worsened, the baby required mechanical ventilation, underwent blood exchange for hyperbilirubinemia, and experienced seizures. Despite treatment, including antioxidant supplementation for the metabolic disorder, acidosis persisted. Genetic analysis identified a previously unreported mutation in a gene associated with glutathione metabolism, inherited from the asymptomatic father. After 18 days of intensive care and with a poor prognosis, the parents opted to discontinue treatment, and the infant passed away shortly after discharge. They declined an autopsy.",

         "A six-month-old girl was admitted to the pediatric unit with fever, cough, stridor, vomiting, and respiratory distress for seven days. She had previously been hospitalized multiple times and had required intensive care during the two previous hospitalizations. Of note, when the patient was not ill, she was healthy and noted to be asymptomatic. Birth history was uneventful, but one sibling died due to the same condition. Second-degree consanguinity was documented between the parents. On initial assessment, the patient was lethargic and dehydrated with marked Kussmaul breathing. Blood gas analysis revealed metabolic acidosis (pH 7.22, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) 14.6 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3; 5.9 mmol/l) with a high anion gap (20.7 mmol/l) and an increased base excess (-19.1 mmol/l). Computed tomography (CT) chest showed bilateral ground-glass appearance (infective), complete blood count (CBC) showed a high total leukocyte count (TLC) of 37, mostly neutrophil (60%), and her C-reactive protein (CRP) was 1.56 mg/dl. The results of the biochemical analysis were within normal limits (ammonia 37 umol/l). Ketonuria was also present (ketone 3+ / 300 mg/dl). The patient was suspected to have bronchopneumonia with concern for underlying metabolic disorder. The patient was initiated on antibiotic ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg/day. Repeat arterial blood gas (ABG) revealed continued metabolic acidosis and the patient was initiated on a continuous bicarbonate infusion. Subsequent ABGs after the infusion of bicarbonate showed an improvement in her metabolic acidosis. Plasma amino acids and urine for organic acids were sent to evaluate for underlying metabolic disorders. The patient was also initiated on oral sodium bicarbonate, biotin, vitamin B12, and protein-free milk, and mother's milk was stopped after consultation with the chemical pathologist. The patient improved with the treatment and was shifted to the ward. She was initially on nasogastric feed and gradually oral feed was established. Repeated CBC showed hemoglobin of 6 mg/dl and red cell concentrates (RCC) was transfused at 10ml/kg during the treatment. Urine organic acid analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry showed marked excretion of 3-hydroxybutyric acid along with moderate excretion of 3-hydroxy-isovaleric acid, the diagnosis was made and the patient was sent home with medication and a scheduled follow-up.",

Prior to this, he exhibited normal development, achieving head control, rolling over, and displaying social interaction. A febrile episode had led to three brief convulsions and subsequent loss of previously attained milestones. Examination revealed a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 10/15, dystonia, hypotonia, and no significant systemic abnormalities. Initial neuroimaging (MRI) revealed frontoparietal atrophy, a characteristic \"bat-wing appearance,\" and changes in the basal ganglia. Further metabolic workup showed low levels of carnitine and abnormal organic acid levels in the urine. Treatment with a low-protein diet, riboflavin, and L-carnitine was initiated, leading to a halt in the rapid neurological deterioration. After discharge, follow-up revealed improvement in motor functions without recurrence of seizures.",

The woman had no neonatal jaundice; however, at the age of 1 year, marked hepatomegaly (2 cm) and splenomegaly (7 cm) were noted. Vacuolated lymphocytes were observed in her blood and cerebrospinal fluid, and many foam cells were observed in the bone marrow. The enzymatic activity of acid sphingomyelinase in skin fibroblasts had decreased to 17 nmol/mg/h (118 53). However, contrary to the expected severe prognosis of known infantile cases, she survived well with minimal neurological symptoms. The patient developed auditory hallucinations, nocturnal urination, and sleep paralysis at the ages of 3, 6, and 9 years, respectively. These symptoms gradually subsided by the age of 12 years. She had an eating disorder between the ages of 17 19 years, and excessive daytime sleepiness appeared at the age of 19 years. Orofacial and oromandibular dystonic movements with facial pain appeared at the age of 27 years. At the age of 28 years, when she was referred to our hospital, she was neurologically intact except for the dystonia. Ultrasonography detected mild unpalpable splenomegaly.",

Childhood acquisitions were normal, but school performances were noted to be poor, because of slow learning, mild difficulties in writing, reading and speaking. However, he could follow a normal educational training. When he was 16 years old, he was hospitalized for an acute paranoid delirium, which resolved after 2 months. Three years later he experienced another acute episode but with persistence of psychotic features suggestive of paranoid. During the following years, he became clumsy with poor upper limbs coordination. Cognitive troubles appeared, including apathy, memory impairment and a dysexecutive syndrome which progressively worsened. At 21 years of age, neurological examination revealed a tetra pyramidal syndrome, gait and limbs cerebellar ataxia, dysarthric speech, dysphagia and VSO. At the age of 24 years, he had lost gait and speech. Dystonic postures involving hands and legs and myclonic jerks appeared. Gastrostomy was performed at 26 years because of severe deglutition problems. Mild cortical and subcortical atrophy were reported on brain MRI. Electroneuromyography, electroretinogram, visual evoked potentials and abdominal ultrasonography were normal. EEG performed at 23 years of age revealed generalized slowing.",

When 30 years old, she suffered from an acute persecutive delusion with acoustic hallucinations. Persistent delusion led to the diagnosis of schizophrenia. Despite chronic therapy with neuroleptics and mood stabilizers, she experienced eight delusion relapses in 6 years requiring hospitalizations at each time. She refused medical follow-up for the next 4 years. During this period, in addition to psychotic features, she developed slow dysarthric speech, attention and memory impairment, dysphagia and ataxic gait. At the age of 40 years, neurological examination revealed VSO, gait cerebellar ataxia, pyramidal signs, left upper limb rest tremor and rigidity. Neuropsychological evaluation showed dementia with non-fluent aphasia, apragmatism, anosognosia, perseverations, memory impairment, visuoconstructive apraxia and prosopagnosia. Her gait progressively worsened and at the age of 42 years, she was unable to walk alone. Abdominal ultrasonography disclosed hepatomegaly and splenomegaly.

Partial splenectomy was performed at 12 years because of an acute abdominal pain. Lipid analysis of frozen spleen tissue performed by one of us (M.T.V.) revealed a typical pattern and the diagnosis was definitely confirmed later on skin fibroblasts. His psychomotor development was normal and he attended normal school until 15 years old, when his parents and teachers first noticed behavioural disturbances including social isolation, self mutilations, aggressiveness and hyperphagia. A psychiatric evaluation revealed a depressive syndrome. An insulin dependent diabetes mellitus developed at the age of 16 years. Gait abnormalities with falls appeared when he was 19 years old and progressively worsened. At the age of 24 years, behavioural disturbances led to institutionalization. Neurological examination found gait and upper limbs cerebellar syndrome and VSO. Neuropsychological evaluation was not possible. Brain MRI showed mild cortical, subcortical and corpus callosum atrophy with relative sparing of the posterior fossae. He experienced one generalized tonic clonic seizure and frequent sudden falls without loss of consciousness, suggestive of cataplexy. He died at 30 years of age in a bedridden state. Electroneuromyography, EEG and brain MRI were normal.",

At the age of 34 years, he developed acute delirium with paranoid delusion and dissociative features. Neuroleptic therapy led to partial improvement. On examination, he was alert and well oriented but a pyramidal syndrome was noted. Over the next 4 years, attention deficit and difficulties in finding words worsened. Neuropsychological evaluation, at the age of 38, showed diffuse cognitive alterations, with predominant frontal lobe dysfunction, memory impairment and visuoconstructive apraxia. He rapidly deteriorated within the next months with acute renal failure, acute delirium, dysphagia, cachexia and dehydration, requiring a combination of dialysis, sedative drugs and gastrostomy. He subsequently became catatonic and bedridden with total dependence. Routine laboratory tests, chest radiography and brain MRI were reported to be normal. He died at 39 years of age.",

However, she attended normal school, obtained the French baccalaureat and started a professional training course. When 17 years old, neurological abnormalities were first seen including dysarthric speech, gait and limb cerebellar ataxia and mild dysphagia. At 19 years, VSO was also found, together with brisk deep tendon reflexes and dystonia of the right lower and upper limbs. She also experienced several sudden falls while standing, without loss of consciousness, that were described as a tonus loss and were suggestive of cataplexy. General examination did not show splenomegaly but this was found with ultrasonography. Gait difficulties progressively increased but when 23 years old, she was still autonomous for activities of daily living. CT-scan of the brain was normal. She refused MRI. Electroneuromyography was normal and EEG showed non-specific bilateral slow waves.",

         "Age at onset could not be determined with precision in this female patient. She had hearing loss since the age of 3, and her familial history was remarkable for deafness also affecting two of her brothers as well as three nephews. Her physical, motor and intellectual developments were otherwise normal, but she was sometimes clumsy. She attended normal school until the age of 17. She worked successfully in several offices and had two normal pregnancies. When 28 years old, she consulted for deafness but did not complain of other symptoms. A careful neurological evaluation revealed cerebellar dysfunction with ataxic gait, dysmetria, dysarthric speech and VSO. Abdominal ultrasonography showed hepatosplenomegaly. No MRI of the brain was performed. With time, ataxia and dysarthria became more and more invalidating, but her mental capacities remained quite well preserved. Progressive dysphagia led to gastrostomy at the age of 45. She died from septicaemia at the age of 49.",

         "This male patient had no familial history. Following a transient documented episode of neonatal icterus, hepatosplenomegaly was found on systematic clinical examination when he was 5 weeks old. During childhood, he presented numerous, spontaneously resolutive infections affecting skin and parotid glands, associated with interstitial neuropathy and persistent elevation of sedimentation rate, suggestive of immunodeficiency. A spleen biopsy revealed sea blue histiocytes but no definite diagnosis was made. When 17 years old, he exhibited abnormal, fixed postures of his hands, progressively followed by increasing gait difficulties. Neurological examination at the age of 18 showed generalized cervical and upper limbs dystonia, gait cerebellar ataxia and VSO. Splenomegaly was present. Cortical and cerebellar atrophy were noticed on a brain CT-scan (no MRI was performed). EEG showed diffuse slow waves. The biochemical examination of a liver biopsy (M.T.V.) showed a lipid storage profile typical of the condition and the diagnosis was confirmed on fibroblasts. Chorea and myoclonus affecting all body parts subsequently appeared, leading to a progressive deterioration of his motor skills. In addition, the cerebellar syndrome increased, and finally he became unable to walk alone at the age of 30. A gastrostomy tube was placed because of increasing dysphagia. He died when 32 years old after a post-traumatic cerebral haemorrhage.",

She also had a tendency to flex her head rapidly to see downward which was interpreted as a tic but which can in retrospect be interpreted as a sign of VSO. At 12 years, she benefited from orthoptic re-education. She could achieve a sales person professional position but with difficulties because of calculation impairment. From the age of 19 years she progressively exhibited dysarthria, cerebellar ataxia, dystonic postures involving fingers and VSO. Abdominal ultrasonography disclosed an isolated splenomegaly. At 20 years of age, the diagnosis was made. She was hospitalized in a psychiatric department for 6 months because of social withdrawal, aggressiveness, persecutive delusion and suicide attempts. These psychiatric troubles were controlled with neuroleptics and at the age of 22 years, the patient is still autonomous for most activities of daily living.

         "A 23-year-old man presented with two months of exertional dyspnea and cough with progressive malaise and lethargy. He denied any weight gain, swelling, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He was diagnosed at age 9 months and is the only child of fourth cousin parents of Portuguese ancestry. There is no family history of inherited metabolic disease, heart disease, or sudden unexplained deaths. He was initially treated with levo-carnitine, but had stopped taking it for 5 years as he reported unpleasant \"fishy\" body and urine odor. Examination revealed a blood pressure of 115/87 mmHg, a regular heart rate of 122 beats per minute, respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute on room air. The jugular venous pulsation was elevated above the angle of the jaw. His apex was laterally displaced. A normal S1, physiologically split S2, and S3 were auscultated. The remainder of the cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, musculoskeletal, neurological, and dermatological examination was unremarkable. Investigations revealed a normal complete blood count. Brain natriuretic peptide was elevated at 2067 pg/mL and troponin I levels were undetectable. Urinary organic acid analysis by mass spectrometry detected massive amounts of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric and methylglutaconic acids. Serum total free carnitine was 11 mol/L (normal 16 66 mol/L), total carnitine 17 mol/L (normal 25 88 mol/L), and beta-hydroxybutyrate was undetectable. Creatinine kinase and thyroid stimulating hormone were normal. Viral studies were negative. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. Chest radiograph showed an increased cardiothoracic ratio, a small left pleural effusion, and normal pulmonary vascularity and interstitial markings. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging revealed severe left ventricular enlargement (left ventricular end diastolic volume of 354 mL) with an ejection fraction of 15% and an apical thrombus, severe right ventricular dysfunction, severe biatrial enlargement, but no valvular disease. There was no evidence of myocarditis.",

         "A 17-year-old male patient presented to the emergency room acutely ill. Since childhood the patient was fed with frequent carbohydrate rich meals during daytime and with a continuous corn-starch based formula at night administered through a percutaneous gastric feeding tube. The patient s level of metabolic control was suboptimal, and he suffered from severe hepatomegaly, nephromegaly, hyperlipidemia, and short stature. He had been hospitalized several times for severe lactic academia usually associated with fasting or nonadherence to the recommended diet. These episodes responded to treatment with dextrose and bicarbonate infusions. The patient had been feeling ill for at least 7 days and had a 2-day history of nausea, weakness, and dyspnea. He had been unable to eat for several days and had not received his usual nighttime corn-starch based formula. Even though he had felt sick, he had delayed coming to the emergency room or notifying his physicians. Emergency medical personnel who were called to take him to the hospital noted respiratory distress and a blood glucose of 28 mg/dL. During transport, he was given intravenous dextrose. On arrival to the emergency room, the patient appeared dyspneic with a Kussmaul respiratory pattern, pronounced tachycardia, and a state of high anxiety. His blood pressure was 143/78, and rectal temperature was 36.5 C. On physical examination, the patient was highly anxious and diaphoretic and had a firm enlarged liver. Laboratory testing done on admission indicated that the patient s hypoglycemia had been reversed (serum glucose of 133 mg/dL (7.4 mmol/L)), but there was a severe metabolic acidosis (pH of 7.11, HCO3, 4 mEq/L, and pCO2, 12.8 mmHg). The initial serum lactate was 27 mmol/L (normal range 0.5 2.2 mmol/L). Mild renal impairment (creatinine 79 mol/L) and mild leukocytosis were also noted.",

         "A 66-year-old male business manager with past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and intermittent sinusitis was transferred to our tertiary care center for progressive encephalopathy and concern for nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Three weeks prior to admission, he was prescribed a 10-day course of levofloxacin for presumed sinusitis. As cough and postnasal drip did not improve, he was treated with two courses of methylprednisolone in addition to levofloxacin and subsequently clarithromycin. Two days prior to presentation, he developed headaches and sinus pressure and complained about feeling off, epigastric pain, and dry heaving. The night prior to presentation, he awoke frequently throughout the night with progressive confusion. The patient did not have fever, chills, or sweats. His family reported a history of anxiety, panic attacks, claustrophobia, and anger outbursts, with the last notable outburst having occurred about 6 months earlier. Of note, coworkers found a collection of various over-the-counter vitamins and nutritional supplements at the patient s desk. Given increasing confusion and agitation, the patient was taken to another hospital where he became progressively more obtunded, requiring intubation for airway protection. He was empirically started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir for concern of infectious meningoencephalitis. CSF analysis revealed elevated total protein at 53 mg/dL, glucose of 160 mg/dL (serum glucose: 240 mg/dL), no pleocytosis (1 WBC/mm3), negative CSF VDRL, negative West nile virus IgM and IgG, negative cryptococcal antigen, and negative fungal and bacterial cultures. Due to development of teeth grinding and concern for subclinical seizure activity, a routine electroencephalogram (EEG) was performed that revealed no seizure activity, however findings consistent with global cerebral dysfunction. He was started on phenytoin and subsequently on levetiracetam. An MRI of the brain showed chronic mild periventricular white matter hyperintensities but no acute findings. He was transferred to our tertiary care center on hospital day 3 for concern of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. On examination, he was intubated and mechanically ventilated, with no abnormal general physical findings. On neurological examination, he was comatose, with intact brainstem reflexes and extensor posturing in all extremities to central stimulation. Initial laboratory work was notable for normal liver function panel, serum ammonia 120 g/dL (reference range 65 107 g/dL), and negative hepatitis panel, as well as respiratory alkalosis. Repeat CSF analysis showed 3 WBC/mm3 (76% neutrophils), 1 RBC/mm3, lactic acid 2.6 meq/L, total protein 28.5 mg/dL, and negative herpes simplex virus PCR as well as negative enterovirus panel, and acyclovir was discontinued. Treatment with lactulose was begun, but serum ammonia rapidly rose to 494 g/dL within a few hours of arrival to our hospital. Rifaximin and L-carnitine were added, and emergent hemodialysis was initiated. An MRI of the brain on day of transfer showed extensive areas of restricted diffusion with associated FLAIR hyperintensity involving bilateral temporal lobes and bilateral insular, bilateral frontal, and parietal regions in cortical and subcortical areas and diffuse mild effacement of the cerebral sulci, without enhancing lesions. Continuous electroencephalogram (cEEG) for a duration of 96 hours showed continuous, irregular, generalized low voltage slowing; however, intermittently observed facial and lip twitching did not have an electrographic correlate on cEEG. The MRI findings of symmetric grey matter involvement in the abovementioned areas, and in absence of hypoxic-ischemic insult and seizure activity, were deemed most consistent with hyperammonemic encephalopathy. The patient underwent continuous venous hemofiltration for two consecutive days followed by regular hemodialysis for two days, with sustained corre",

         "The first child is a female born at 37 weeks of gestation by ventouse delivery from consanguineous parents from Pakistan. Pregnancy and delivery were uneventful. Growth parameters were normal. Early developmental milestones were age-appropriate in all domains, although she tired quickly when she first started to walk. At the age of five, she developed viral gastroenteritis. Subsequent blood tests revealed her ALT level was six times higher than the normal range (Figure 2). Subsequent ALT monitoring showed a persisting increase after the resolution of the intercurrent illness, triggering investigations for infectious, autoimmune, and metabolic etiologies. This revealed isolated plasma hypermethioninemia at 985 mol/L (normal 10 60) and high urine methionine/creatinine ratio at 46 mol/mmol (normal 3 10), mildly elevated plasma homocysteine level 15 mol/L (normal 5 10), and elevation of muscle enzymes with elevated ALT 250 IU/L (normal 5 25) and high CK 1450 IU/L (normal <250). Indicators of chronic liver failure were observed, with mildly low albumin level 36 g/L (normal 37 56) and a normal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level. Notably, coagulation abnormalities, which are frequently seen in SAHH deficiency, were also present, as evidenced by a prolonged PT of 19.8 s (normal 9.6 11.8) and low fibrinogen levels of 0.8 g/L (normal 1.7 4.0) (Figure 2). Despite these biological abnormalities, the clinical examination was unremarkable. Specifically, there were no clinical signs suggesting coagulation abnormalities. Additionally, there was an absence of visceromegaly, normal muscular strength (including a negative Gowers test), and a standard neurological examination. A formal neuropsychological assessment using the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children (WISC-V) showed good motivation, concentration, and intellectual abilities in the low average range. However, she produced an uneven profile, with weaker abilities in verbal reasoning abilities (below average) and strengths in processing speed (high average). The child attends mainstream school with no difficulties with academic tasks and physical exercise at age 9. Growth was appropriate with weight on the 9th centile and height on the 25th centile. 12 leads ECG, echocardiography, and liver ultrasound were normal. Her brain MRI showed mild leukodystrophy with confluent hyperintense white matter signal changes predominantly involving the deep and subcortical white matter, sparing the extreme subcortical, periventricular, and parts of deep white matter (Figure 3). A muscle MRI showed only a minimal bilateral streaking of the posterior compartment muscles, especially involving the adductor Magnus.",

         "A full term, female infant was born to a G1P0 mother whose fetal ultrasound was concerning at 27 weeks gestation. The newborn had a normal clinical exam with normal muscular tone, and postnatal ECG showed mild hypertrophy of the interventricular septum. Electrocardiogram (EKG) was notable for a very short PR interval, ventricular pre-excitation, and high ventricular voltages. At 2 days of life, GAA enzyme level was low at 1.5 nmol/mg protein (normal 6 37 nmol/mg protein) on leukocyte-based assay at a local lab, urine (E)-hex-4-en-1-yl butyrate (HEX4) was elevated at 34 nmol/mol (normal <19 nmol/mol creatinine), and creatinine kinase was elevated at 2261 IU/L (normal 38 174 IU/L). Given this presentation, suspicion was high. Biopsies of skeletal muscle and skin were obtained, and ERT with alglucosidase alfa was promptly started while waiting for biopsy results to determine CRIM status. Echocardiography at age 3 months no longer showed hypertrophy of the intraventricular septum, but the mitral valve was thickened and tethered by shortened chordae. There was moderate mitral regurgitation and subsequent moderate left ventricular dilation, for which captopril was started. The patient remained on ERT, with normalization of creatinine kinase and urine HEX4 but demonstrating failure to thrive and mild developmental delay. As the clinical picture and cardiac findings did not fit, skin fibroblast GAA level using maltose as substrate was performed, which measured at 1.8 mol/min/mg protein, which was 8.82% of the normal control (control mean = 20.4 2.3 mol/min/mg protein) and not consistent. GAA sequencing subsequently identified a single common late-onset heterozygous mutation (c. -32-13 T > G). DNA microarray analysis was negative for a large deletion of the GAA gene in trans. Biochemical analysis of the skeletal muscle biopsy showed normal glycogen content of 0.49% (control 0.94 0.55%) and low normal GAA activity of 0.2 mol/min/g tissue (control 0.42 0.20 mol/min/g tissue). Subsequently, blood GAA enzyme activity was tested after stopping ERT for a few months; as it measured in the low normal range (6.13pmo/punch/h; control = 10.88 pmol/punch/h), it further ruled out the diagnosis. Light microscopic examination of skeletal muscle showed mild myopathic changes, including increased variation in fiber diameter, a mild increase in lipid, and slightly increased amounts of cytoplasmic glycogen. No rimmed vacuoles were seen, and electron microscopy found no membrane-bound glycogen, so there was no support for a lysosomal glycogen storage disorder. Given these results, the diagnosis was no longer supported. Blood was sent for a commercially available panel, and a heterozygous mutation in PRKAG2 (c.1423A > G p. Lys475Glu) was identified. This was a novel missense mutation predicted to be disease causing for PRKAG2 cardiac syndrome, as it leads to a nonconservative amino acid substitution, occurs at a highly conserved position in the gene, is not a known benign polymorphism, and mutations affecting nearby codons (Tyr487His and Asn488Ile) have been described as disease causing. Echocardiogram (ECG), electrocardiogram (EKG), and PRKAG2 genetic testing were normal in both parents, indicating a de novo mutation in their daughter. The patient was diagnosed with PRKAG2 cardiac syndrome with a carrier status, and ERT was stopped at 8 months of age. Creatinine kinase and urine HEX4 levels were followed for 1 year after stopping ERT and remained normal. Follow-up ECGs continued to show thickened mitral valve leaflets with shortened chordae and moderate mitral valve regurgitation with left ventricular dilation but no ventricular hypertrophy. At 5 years of age, the child continues on captopril for afterload reduction, but she remains asymptomatic from a cardiovascular standpoint and has no overt musculoskeletal weakness per report from the treating physician.",

         "A full-term female infant had wheezing at 5 weeks of age and failed bronchodilator therapy for presumed reactive airway disease. At 11 weeks of age, she presented with more severe wheezing at her pediatrician's office, which prompted referral to the emergency room. Chest X-ray showed severe cardiomegaly, and an ECG demonstrated severe biventricular hypertrophy, severe mitral regurgitation, and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. EKG showed biventricular hypertrophy, a short PR interval, and interventricular conduction delay. She was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit where she was started on milrinone, oxygen, and furosemide for heart failure. She developed persistent ventricular ectopy, which required a lidocaine infusion. Suspicion for was high, but blood GAA enzyme activity level was normal at 15.8 pmol/punch/h (normal 10.88 pmol/punch/h), and GAA gene sequencing and urine HEX4 were also normal. Because of the care team's experience with PRKAG2 cardiac syndrome in the patient described in case 1, this was high in the differential diagnosis. Blood was sent for a commercially available familial HCM panel, which showed a disease-causing mutation in the PRKAG2 gene (c.1592G > A p. Arg531Gln). The patient had persistent arrhythmias and poor cardiac function requiring high-dose inotropy and was therefore listed for cardiac transplant at 3 months of age. She remained in the hospital on milrinone infusion awaiting transplant, but her clinical status continued to decline. At 4 months of age, she had an episode of cardiac arrest requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) cannulation. She then developed severe renal dysfunction, a large right intracerebral hemorrhage presumably from anticoagulation required for ECMO, and was unable to recover any meaningful cardiac function. The decision was made by the family and healthcare team to withdraw support, and the patient died at 4 months of age. No muscle tissue biopsy or autopsy was performed.",

Evaluation during these admissions showed creatinine kinase mildly elevated at 197 IU/L (normal 38 174 IU/L) and blood enzyme level (done at the local facility) was low at 4.81 U (18.66-U control sample). ECG showed mild hypertrophy of the interventricular septum but an otherwise normal left ventricular mass. EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm without evidence of pre-excitation or hypertrophy. Due to his persistent hypotonia, muscle weakness, and low enzyme level, he was diagnosed with nonclassic at 11 months of age and started on ERT with alglucosidase alfa. After just 3 months of ERT, the patient showed significant improvement in motor skills; he could crawl well, sit unassisted, and pull to a standing position none of which he could do prior to starting ERT. At 2.5 years of age, he had a normal gait and could jump and climb stairs. The previously noted hypertrophy of the interventricular septum resolved, and he had no abnormalities on ECG or EKG. Given the patient's unusual course and atypical presentation for, additional testing was performed at 2.5 years of age. Enzyme testing on skin fibroblasts was normal at 50.7 nmol/h/mg (control 45 180 nmol/h/mg). Gene sequencing identified a heterozygous mutation (c. -32-13 T > G), consistent with being a carrier of. Parental testing showed the same heterozygous mutation in his mother and no abnormalities in his father. These new data no longer supported a diagnosis of, and ERT was discontinued. To identify the true cause of his myopathy, further testing was performed. At age 3, he underwent a quadriceps muscle biopsy that showed mild myopathic features on light microscopy, including increased variation in fiber size, focal myocyte degeneration, a mild increase in cytoplasmic glycogen and other intermyofibrillar material, and subsarcolemmal blebs of uncertain composition. No rimmed vacuoles were seen, and electron microscopy showed no membrane-bound glycogen, which argued against a lysosomal glycogen storage disease. Finally, a glycogen storage disease sequencing panel showed a pathogenic mutation in PRKAG2 (c. 298G > A p. Gly100Ser), a known disease-causing mutation. The patient, now 7 years old, was restarted on ERT just before his fourth birthday due to worsening muscle weakness when off ERT. He continues to make progress in gross motor skills and has some fine motor delays, but there is no further evidence of HCM or pre-excitation.",

         "The patient was seen for the first time at the age of 9 years as an outpatient in the division of paediatric cardiology. The boy s somatic development was normal, but his speech and intellectual development were slightly below age-appropriate limits, prompting special schooling. According to his mother he showed sweating and dyspnoea at exertion, but was otherwise asymptomatic. Auscultation revealed a split first heart sound and a rough systolic ejection murmur over the third left intercostal space. Blood pressure was 105/57. The electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm, incomplete right bundle branch block, and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy; echocardiography disclosed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. Due to further progression of the condition with mitral valve insufficiency, massive obstructive cardiomyopathy affecting both ventricles, and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, the boy was listed for heart transplantation, which was performed at the age of 12.6 years. A muscle biopsy was performed prior to transplantation. Biochemical investigations of the muscle tissue revealed normal activities excluding disorders of the mitochondrial energy metabolism. The possibility of a specific condition was substantiated by immunohistochemistry. Almost 2 years after transplantation the boy did not show episodes of organ rejection. Ophthalmic examination revealed myopia, peripheral pigmentary retinopathy, and lenticular opacities.",

         "A girl, the fourth child of consanguineous parents (first cousins), was born at 38 weeks of gestation after a pregnancy complicated by polyhydramnios. Birth weight was 2180 g (< 3rd percentile), length 47 cm ( 10th percentile), head circumference 30 cm (< 3rd percentile), and APGAR score 8/9. One brother, born at term, and one premature sister, had both died 6 h (presumed perinatal asphyxia) and two days (cause not reported), respectively, after birth. Ultrasound images of the fourth child showed agenesis of the corpus callosum and mild bilateral pyelocaliceal dilatation. At physical examination, dysmorphic features were noted, such as hypertelorism, overriding sutures, hooked nose, micrognathia, camptodactyly of the fifth finger, single transverse palmar crease on the left hand and postaxial polydactyly on the right hand. Immediately after birth and during the following 17 days, she presented with hypoglycemic episodes difficult to control (glucose: 20 40 mg/dl). Laboratory exams, performed during one of these episodes, showed lactic acidemia (4.0 mol/ml; N: 0.7 2.5 mol/ml), mild hyperammonemia, and marked metabolic acidosis (pH 7.20; pCO2 25.1 mmHg; HCO3- 9.6 mEq/L; BE -17.5 mEq/L). Neurologic exam, performed at 4 days of life, showed incomplete Moro reflex, posture of limbs flexion, reduced axial tonus, and slightly elevated appendicular tonus. At 6 days of life, antibiotics were administered for one week due to suspicion of sepsis. On the seventh and 25th days, two samples of urine and one of plasma were collected and sent for inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) screening. Amino acid analyses were carried out on a Biochrom 20 (Biochrom Ltd., Cambridge, UK) amino acid analyzer. Sample preparation and analysis were performed according to the manufacturer s standard protocols. General aminoaciduria was observed and some plasma amino acids were also altered. Urinary organic acid analyses by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) showed massive excretion of fumaric acid (> 232 mmol/mol creatinine, normal range < 45 mmol/mol creatinine). The same result was presented by a new urine sample collected at 40 days of life. At 1 month of age, despite breast feeding and normal sucking, the baby had extreme difficulty gaining weight, remaining undernourished due to persistent vomiting and occasional diarrhea. Cholestatic jaundice and hepatomegaly were noted since birth. At 40 days of life, the following hepatic enzymes were altered: aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 137 U/L, N 10 34 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 78 U/L, N 5 35 U/L; alkaline leukocyte phosphatase (ALP) 267 U/L, N 20 140 U/L, and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase ( GT) 505 U/L, N 0 51 U/L. Further exams at this period revealed colpocephaly [cranial computed tomography (CT)], infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis [abdominal ultrasound (US)] and interatrial communication (ECO). At one-and-a-half months of age, pyloromyotomy was performed, but vomiting episodes persisted. At this time, she still presented with lactic acidemia (5.0 mol/ml), metabolic acidosis, and mild hyperammonemia. Hemotransfusion was performed due to anemia. At 2 months and 4 days, hemoculture was positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis, and she was treated with antibiotics for 14 days. There was a small weight gain, but hepatic enzymes remained altered. At 3 months and 5 days, the girl was discharged but continued to gain weight slowly, although being fed with breast milk and supplementary formula. Vomiting episodes twice a day and occasional diarrhea persisted. At 4 months and 9 days, she was readmitted owing to vomiting with traces of blood, hyperpyrexia, intense crying and pallor, dyspnea, and dehydration. Besides hepatosplenomegaly, she presented with severe metabolic acidosis (pH 6.45; pCO2 32 mmHg; HCO3 2 mEq/L; BE 32 mEq/L) and bradycardia, which evolved to cardiac arrest and death. It was not possible to measure enzymatic activity and perform further tests.",

He was born without complications at 39 weeks and 6 days, was 50 cm (+0.49 standard deviation (SD)) in length, and weighed 3168 g (+0.38 SD). Newborn mass screening (NBS) using tandem mass spectrometry revealed no abnormalities. He was referred to a local general hospital owing to the development of ascites, liver atrophy, and liver tumor, and was suspected of liver failure resulting from an inherited metabolic disorder. He received mitochondrial rescue therapy including vitamin B1, carnitine, and coenzyme Q10. Moreover, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), antithrombin III, albumin, and vitamin K were administered because of a coagulation disorder. However, treatment for liver failure and the coagulation disorder did not lead to a significant improvement. The patient was transferred to our institution because of the need for LT. He appeared sick, presented with drowsiness, and was jaundiced with the following vital signs: body temperature, 39.7 C; blood pressure, 140/125 mmHg; respiratory rate, 35 breaths/min; pulse, 190 bpm at a regular cardiac rhythm; and oxygen saturation, 90% with oxygen at 2 L/min. Subcutaneous hemorrhage and purple spots were seen scattered from the hypogastric region to the scrotum. He was intubated and his breathing was managed with a ventilator. Laboratory tests revealed anemia (hemoglobin: 7.1 g/dL), thrombocytopenia (platelets: 9.6 10^4/ L), hypoproteinemia (total protein: 4.6 g/dL), and coagulopathy (prothrombin time (PT): 32.6 s (reference: 11.0 15.2 s), PT-international normalized ratio: 2.73 and activated partial thromboplastin time: 51.4 s (reference: 25.2 35.2 s)). Liver function tests revealed unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin: 3.2 mg/dL, direct bilirubin: 0.8 mg/dL). The blood alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level was very high (196,931.0 ng/mL). Administration of FFP, antithrombin III, albumin, and vitamin K was continued. The patient underwent combination therapy with PE and CHDF, and ascitic fluid was removed using continuous drainage. Moreover, he received antibiotic therapy with aminobenzylpenicillin and clindamycin following ceftriaxone sodium hydrate and vancomycin hydrochloride owing to Staphylococcus agalactiae or group B Streptococcus infection in the blood. Urine organic acid analysis demonstrated significantly increased levels of SA and tyrosine metabolites (p-hydroxyphenyl lactic acid [PHPLA] and p-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid [PHPPA]). Moreover, the analysis revealed increased levels of lactic acid, pyruvic acid, phenyllactic acid, phenylpyruvic acid, and phenylacetic acid. Blood amino acids analysis showed increased methionine (448.0 mol/L [reference value: 18.9 40.5 mol/L]), tyrosine (205.9 mol/L [reference value: 40.4 90.3 mol/L]), and phenylalanine (115.2 mol/L [reference control: 42.6 75.7 mol/L]) levels. He was diagnosed with an inherited metabolic disorder and received NTBC (2 mg/kg/day) and tyrosine- and phenylalanine-free formula. NTBC treatment lowered blood AFP levels (36,252.0 ng/mL and 11,386.0 ng/mL at 2 days and 6 days after NTBC treatment, respectively). However, the coagulation disorder showed no signs of improvement. The liver mass in segment VI showed a tendency to expand, and other multiple masses appeared in the liver. He underwent living donor LT from his mother and was recovered from ALF. Blood gene analysis revealed compound heterozygous mutations NM_000137.4(FAH):c.782C > T (p.Pro261Leu) (a previously reported pathogenic variant allele), c.565G > A (p.Val189Ile), and c.688C > G (p.Leu230Val) (novel likely pathogenic variant) in FAH. In addition, NM_000137.4(FAH):c.565G > A (p.Val189Ile) (a previously reported likely nonpathogenic allele) was also identified. The patient was definitively diagnosed with an inherited metabolic disorder.",

         "A 20-month-old girl was referred to pediatric ward at Shahid Sadoughi hospital due to anorexia, recurrent vomiting, and progressive respiratory distress following a viral respiratory infection. She had previously been hospitalized on the second day of birth due to tachypnea and at 11 months old because of hypoglycemia and metabolic acidosis and elevated liver enzymes following gastroenteritis. She had normal development. She was born out of consanguineous marriage. On examination, she weighed nine kilograms (5%) and had severe respiratory distress and hepatomegaly (Liver span: 9 cm). Her laboratory data is presented in Table 1. In urine organic acid test: Lactic acid (754 mmol/molcr, NL<60), Glycerol-3-phosphate (186 mmol/molcr, NL<13) were increased while glycerol was normal. This pattern is suggestive of deficiency. Genetic studies confirmed this diagnosis. Patient with suspected hereditary metabolic disease was treated with serum DW10% (1.5 times preservative fluid), intravenous bicarbonate, and antibiotics after sending in metabolic tests. Given the high blood sugar during treatment, intravenous insulin was prescribed at a dose of 0.05 Iu/Kg/hour. The patient's acidosis ameliorated after 12 hours (VBG: pH 7.31, HCO3 15, PCO2 30) but she still had respiratory distress and was dependent on oxygen. Increased respiratory distress, cyanosis, decreased arterial oxygen saturation and progressive lung involvement resulted in the intubation of the patient be connected to a ventilator. According to the infectious consultation, the patient was prescribed antibiotics. Echocardiography reported right and left heart failure (EF = 30-35%) and appropriate management was undertaken for heart failure. Pulmonary edema (White lung) was reported on chest x-ray due to respiratory infection and unfortunately the patient expired.",

The patient also exhibited extensive Mongolian spots and had been previously treated with antibiotics due to a suspicion of sepsis. Physical examination revealed excessive sweating of the palms and reduced movement in both the upper and lower limbs. The patient experienced multiple episodes of fever and dyspnea, each lasting approximately one minute. Cranial ultrasonography indicated periventricular hyperechogenicity, while echocardiography revealed a 4 mm atrial septal defect. Other metabolic investigations returned normal results. At the age of one year, during a telephonic follow-up, the child was still experiencing feeding difficulties but showed progress in reaching developmental milestones. Exome sequencing identified a novel homozygous four base pair deletion, c.828_831delCCGA, in exon 5 of the CRLF1 gene (ENST00000392386.3), leading to a premature truncation of the protein at codon 276 (p.Tyr276Ter).

         "A 34-year-old female, first visited our clinic at the age of 5 in 1989. Previous clinical records until 1992 are unavailable, but a summary indicated congenital nystagmus. She had been diagnosed with [REDACTED] and hyperopia at another clinic and had been wearing glasses since age 3. At her initial visit to our clinic, hyperopia was confirmed. Fundus photographs from that time revealed symmetrical inferior-dominant retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) mottling without bone spicule pigmentation. By 1992, her best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 0.05 (S +6.0) in the right eye and 0.06 (S +5.0) in the left. She had horizontal nystagmus and photophobia and failed the panel D15 test. Anomaloscope testing in 1996 was unmeasurable. By 1998, her bright-flash electroretinography (ERG) was severely attenuated, and 30 Hz flicker ERG was non-recordable in both eyes. At her final clinic visit in 2019, her BCVA had declined to 0.02 (uncorrectable) in the right eye and 0.03 (uncorrectable) in the left. Over the years, fundus photographs documented progressive retinal degeneration and the development of bone spicule pigmentation. Although visual field assessments suggested steady afferent constriction, nystagmus complicated measurements. Autofluorescence imaging revealed donut-shaped retinal degeneration in both eyes. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) performed in 2015 showed that the outer nuclear layer (ONL), ellipsoid zone (EZ), and interdigitation zone (IZ) were preserved in the foveal area, though the preserved region was smaller compared to her sibling. She exhibited no systemic complications.",

         "A 3-day-old female infant was brought to the emergency room following an abnormal newborn screening showing markedly increased isovaleryl/2-methylbutyryl carnitine levels (C5; 23.11 mol/L; reference interval, <0.60 mol/L) and C5/C2, C5/C0, and C5/C3 ratios. At admission, the patient presented with bradycardia and hypothermia (95.4 F) and was treated with intravenous fluids. Routine biochemistry testing indicated mild metabolic acidosis (total CO2, 16.6 mmol/L; reference interval, 21 29 mmol/L) and an anion gap of 23 mmol/L. Plasma ammonia was high (168 mol/L; reference interval, <90 mol/L) and rose further within a few hours to 445 mol/L, requiring therapy with sodium phenylacetate/sodium benzoate (Ammonul). No unusual odor was noted from the child or the child's urine. Follow-up plasma acylcarnitine analysis by tandem mass spectrometry confirmed the increased C5 (10.98 mol/L; reference interval, <0.30 mol/L). Moreover, to identify the specific defect, a urine sample was sent for organic acid analysis by GC-MS and for acylglycine analysis by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.",

         "A 6-day-old baby was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit due to severe metabolic acidosis and related complications. The infant was born healthy at term to non-consanguineous parents and initially had normal physical examination findings. Jaundice and tachypnea developed on the second day of life, followed by lethargy and severe metabolic acidosis. Laboratory tests revealed elevated blood ammonia levels and hemolytic anemia with indirect hyperbilirubinemia. Notably, metabolic screening indicated increased glutamic acid and significant excretion of 5-oxoproline. As the condition worsened, the baby required mechanical ventilation, underwent blood exchange for hyperbilirubinemia, and experienced seizures. Despite treatment, including antioxidant supplementation for the metabolic disorder, acidosis persisted. Genetic analysis identified a previously unreported mutation in a gene associated with glutathione metabolism, inherited from the asymptomatic father. After 18 days of intensive care and with a poor prognosis, the parents opted to discontinue treatment, and the infant passed away shortly after discharge. They declined an autopsy.",

         "A six-month-old girl was admitted to the pediatric unit with fever, cough, stridor, vomiting, and respiratory distress for seven days. She had previously been hospitalized multiple times and had required intensive care during the two previous hospitalizations. Of note, when the patient was not ill, she was healthy and noted to be asymptomatic. Birth history was uneventful, but one sibling died due to the same condition. Second-degree consanguinity was documented between the parents. On initial assessment, the patient was lethargic and dehydrated with marked Kussmaul breathing. Blood gas analysis revealed metabolic acidosis (pH 7.22, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) 14.6 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3; 5.9 mmol/l) with a high anion gap (20.7 mmol/l) and an increased base excess (-19.1 mmol/l). Computed tomography (CT) chest showed bilateral ground-glass appearance (infective), complete blood count (CBC) showed a high total leukocyte count (TLC) of 37, mostly neutrophil (60%), and her C-reactive protein (CRP) was 1.56 mg/dl. The results of the biochemical analysis were within normal limits (ammonia 37 umol/l). Ketonuria was also present (ketone 3+ / 300 mg/dl). The patient was suspected to have bronchopneumonia with concern for underlying metabolic disorder. The patient was initiated on antibiotic ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg/day. Repeat arterial blood gas (ABG) revealed continued metabolic acidosis and the patient was initiated on a continuous bicarbonate infusion. Subsequent ABGs after the infusion of bicarbonate showed an improvement in her metabolic acidosis. Plasma amino acids and urine for organic acids were sent to evaluate for underlying metabolic disorders. The patient was also initiated on oral sodium bicarbonate, biotin, vitamin B12, and protein-free milk, and mother's milk was stopped after consultation with the chemical pathologist. The patient improved with the treatment and was shifted to the ward. She was initially on nasogastric feed and gradually oral feed was established. Repeated CBC showed hemoglobin of 6 mg/dl and red cell concentrates (RCC) was transfused at 10ml/kg during the treatment. Urine organic acid analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry showed marked excretion of 3-hydroxybutyric acid along with moderate excretion of 3-hydroxy-isovaleric acid, the diagnosis was made and the patient was sent home with medication and a scheduled follow-up.",

Prior to this, he exhibited normal development, achieving head control, rolling over, and displaying social interaction. A febrile episode had led to three brief convulsions and subsequent loss of previously attained milestones. Examination revealed a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 10/15, dystonia, hypotonia, and no significant systemic abnormalities. Initial neuroimaging (MRI) revealed frontoparietal atrophy, a characteristic \"bat-wing appearance,\" and changes in the basal ganglia. Further metabolic workup showed low levels of carnitine and abnormal organic acid levels in the urine. Treatment with a low-protein diet, riboflavin, and L-carnitine was initiated, leading to a halt in the rapid neurological deterioration.

         "The case report describes a 28-day-old newborn female. The infant, born full-term via normal delivery to non-consanguineous parents, initially had normal skin, but developed generalized erythematous plaques with peeling and brownish crusted lesions by 10 days of life. These were primarily around the groin, thighs, abdomen, and back. Additional symptoms included perioral crusting, erythematous papules on the cheeks, and frequent greenish stools (6-7 times per day) without fever. Family history was notable, as the mother, aunt, and two first cousins had similar symptoms in childhood, successfully treated with zinc supplementation. After ineffective initial treatment with topical steroids, the patient responded rapidly to oral zinc, with complete resolution of symptoms by the 6th day of therapy.",

His symptoms initially included erythematous, scaly, and pustular lesions in the inguinal and perianal regions. Recurrent bacterial skin infections, notably with Staphylococcus aureus, delayed diagnosis. The condition was confirmed by low plasma zinc levels, and his symptoms improved significantly with zinc supplementation. A family history noted a sibling who had died at 5 months with similar skin lesions, indicating a potential genetic link. The boy continues to receive zinc therapy with regular follow-ups.",

He also reported dark urine, sperm, and stained underwear for 20 years, with recent worsening. He is obese, hypertensive, and on enalapril. His medical history includes knee arthroscopy, lumbar spine arthrodesis, and Achilles tendon tenorrhaphy. Family history reveals that his sister had \"Coca-Cola color\" in her diapers during childhood. Dermatological examination showed a grayish scleral spot, grayish-blue papules on the second fingers, periurethral hyperpigmentation, and generalized chromonychia. Radiographs indicated calcified lumbar discs and spinal arthrodesis with a metal rod. An incisional biopsy of the papule and a positive urine test for homogentisic acid confirmed the condition. Histopathology revealed hyperkeratosis, basophilic elastotic degeneration, and ochre pigment deposits. The patient was started on vitamin C 500 mg twice daily and advised to avoid phenylalanine-, tyrosine-, and protein-rich diets, with follow-up care by orthopedics, ophthalmology, and cardiology.",

         "Baby boy M. J. was born at 36 weeks' gestational age following a prenatal diagnosis of a chromosomal deletion. His mother, a 21-year-old gravida 2, para 1, had a previous miscarriage at approximately seven weeks' gestation. She denied exposure to alcohol, tobacco, x-rays, or teratogenic medications during pregnancy and reported taking prenatal vitamins. She received regular prenatal care, and the pregnancy remained relatively uncomplicated until a routine ultrasound at approximately 21 weeks' gestation revealed symmetrical intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), with fetal measurements aligning with approximately 19 weeks gestation. The anatomy was difficult to evaluate, prompting a referral to a Maternal-Fetal Medicine Center. A subsequent ultrasound at 24 weeks confirmed symmetrical IUGR, micrognathia, a single umbilical artery, and a potential cardiac defect. An amniocentesis was performed, along with additional testing for other syndromes, which returned normal results. Final chromosomal analysis confirmed an abnormal karyotype involving a deletion on chromosome 4. Maternal prenatal laboratory results indicated blood type A positive, negative tests for syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis B, rubella immunity, and a positive group beta strep culture. A four-generation family history revealed a maternal aunt who died shortly after birth due to complications of a diaphragmatic hernia, a brother and maternal grandmother diagnosed with a cardiac conduction disorder, and a cousin with autism. Other family members had a history of multiple miscarriages, but no known genetic disorders were identified. The mother had mixed Eskimo, French-Canadian, German, English, and possibly Russian ancestry, while the father had German, English, and Mexican ancestry, with no reported consanguinity. M. J. was delivered vaginally following spontaneous labor. His mother experienced premature rupture of membranes for 16 hours before delivery and received antibiotic therapy. The infant was in vertex presentation but exhibited respiratory difficulties at birth. He was hypotonic and apneic, with Apgar scores of 3, 6, and 6 at 1, 5, and 10 minutes, respectively. His birth weight was 1.820 kg, head circumference 30 cm, and length 46 cm, confirming IUGR as all measurements were below the tenth percentile. At 28 minutes of life, he was intubated due to increasing respiratory distress. Thick secretions were noted, requiring frequent suctioning. He had pale skin and diminished tone but improved breathing efforts following intubation. He was directly admitted to the level III neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Upon NICU admission, M. J. was placed on a radiant warmer and conventional ventilator with 50% oxygen. A low-lying umbilical venous catheter was placed, though umbilical arterial catheter placement was unsuccessful. He received a normal saline bolus due to poor perfusion. His chest x-ray findings did not indicate respiratory distress syndrome, and surfactant was not required. Vital signs remained within normal limits for his gestational age. Despite appearing alert, he exhibited significantly low muscle tone and responded to tactile stimulation. His anterior fontanel was soft and flat with overriding sutures. He had micrognathia, a small oral cavity, a deviated airway, a flattened nasal bridge, a high forehead, low-set ears, and abnormal ear helices. He showed mild to moderate intercostal and substernal retractions but had a regular heart rate and rhythm without murmur. His pulses were equal, and his capillary refill time was slightly prolonged. Abdominal examination showed normal bowel sounds with no hepatosplenomegaly, though a two-vessel umbilical cord was noted. Genital findings included micropenis (1 cm), hypospadias with a midshaft urethral opening, and high-positioned but present testes. His skin was pale but well-perfused, with occasional petechiae. He was placed on early total parenteral nutrition (TPN). On day two of life, after achieving cardi",

         "A 13-year-old boy, the first child of a young, unrelated, and apparently healthy couple, with no similar cases reported in the family. The pregnancy progressed without complications. However, a fetal ultrasound scan conducted at 36 weeks of gestation revealed an absence of the corpus callosum. The child was born at full term via cesarean section, with a birth weight of 3600 g, a length of 52 cm, an occipital-frontal circumference of 36.5 cm, and an Apgar score of 8. Postnatal development was significantly delayed. The child raised his head at 18 months, sat without support at 2 years, and had not developed speech by the age of 13 years. Additionally, he experienced recurrent respiratory infections. At 13 years and 7 months, a physical evaluation showed growth parameters below the expected range for his age (weight: 0.89 standard deviation (SD), height: 2.39 SD, occipital-frontal circumference: 1.23 SD). Dysmorphic facial features were noted, along with defects of the lacrimal system and a small palate abnormality. Other findings included a protruding chest wall, separation of abdominal muscles, hypospadias, undescended testes, a sacral sinus, delayed tooth eruption, spastic quadriplegia/tetraparesis, and severe intellectual disability. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the absence of the corpus callosum, along with mild dilatation of the ventricular system. Additional malformations included a cardiac defect (atrial septal defect) and bilateral optic atrophy. Genetic analysis revealed a normal male karyotype (46,XY), while multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) confirmed a ~2 Mb deletion in a region associated with developmental anomalies.",

         "A 1-year-old boy, the only child of an unrelated couple, presented with no other affected family members. The pregnancy was uneventful, and he was born at term with a birth weight of 2700 g and an Apgar score of 7. Head circumference and birth length were not documented. Postnatal development has been severely delayed, as he is unable to raise his head and has not developed speech. During the most recent clinical examination, he was found to have a significantly reduced weight (-5.7 SD), microcephaly (-3.91 SD), a dysmorphic facial appearance, and a sacral sinus. Additional clinical features include an atrial septal defect, seizures, and recurrent respiratory infections. Genetic analysis revealed a karyotype of 46,XY with deletions at 4p16.3 and 22q11.23. Further molecular investigations using the MLPA P245 Probemix detected an approximately 2 Mb deletion in the 4p region, along with a smaller deletion in the 22q11.2 region. The 4p deletion was confirmed using the P096 MLPA kit, while the 22q11.2 deletion involving the RTDR1 gene was validated with the P250 MLPA kit.",

The Apgar score at birth was 1. Postnatal development was delayed, with head control achieved at 4 months and independent sitting at 8 months. At 4 years and 4 months, the patient presented with proportionate short stature (weight: 2.6 SD, height: 4.08 SD), marked microcephaly (OFC: 7.41 SD), and distinct facial dysmorphism. Additional findings included a right iris coloboma, anodontia, a left preauricular pit, muscle hypotonia, severe intellectual disability, and hearing loss. The patient also had congenital heart defects, including atrial septal defect (ASD), ventricular septal defect (VSD), tricuspid insufficiency, and mitral and pulmonary insufficiency. Genetic analysis revealed a karyotype of 46,XX with a deletion at chromosome 4p16.1-pter, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) confirmed an ~8 Mb deletion in the region.",

         "A 4-year-old girl, the only child of non-related parents, presented with developmental concerns. The pregnancy was complicated by a threatening miscarriage and polyhydramnios. She was born at term via cesarean section, with an Apgar score of 9, a birth weight of 2500 g, a length of 48 cm, and an occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) of 31.5 cm. Postnatal development was delayed, and seizures affecting the right side of the body were observed. Physical examination revealed small stature (weight: 3.2 SD, height: 4.15 SD), microcephaly (OFC: 4.66 SD), a dysmorphic facial appearance, congenital cataracts, dental anomalies, a sacral sinus, two tuberous hemangiomas, and hypotonia. Additionally, the patient presented with atrial septal defect (ASD), ventricular septal defect (VSD), and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Genetic analysis showed a karyotype of 46,XX, and MLPA P096 Probemix confirmed a ~2 Mb deletion in a specific chromosomal region associated with known clinical features.",

         "A 1-year-old boy, the only child of an unrelated couple, presented with no other affected family members. The pregnancy was uneventful, and he was born at term with a birth weight of 2700 g and an Apgar score of 7. Head circumference and birth length were not documented. Postnatal development has been severely delayed, as he is unable to raise his head and has not developed speech. During the most recent clinical examination, he was found to have a significantly reduced weight (-5.7 SD), microcephaly (-3.91 SD), a dysmorphic facial appearance, and a sacral sinus. Additional clinical features include an atrial septal defect, seizures, and recurrent respiratory infections. Genetic analysis revealed a karyotype of 46,XY with deletions at 4p16.3 and 22q11.23. Further molecular investigations using the MLPA P245 Probemix detected an approximately 2 Mb deletion in the 4p region, along with a smaller deletion in the 22q11.2 region. The 4p deletion was confirmed using the P096 MLPA kit, while the 22q11.2 deletion involving the RTDR1 gene was validated with the P250 MLPA kit.",
